    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked into Ops at oh-eight-hundred hours. As I crossed to my usual duty station, it came to me finally, why the hell I was here. Why I&rsquo;d washed and painted and animated my lifeless form for this, to show up, to drag myself in. I&rsquo;d shown up so I could get myself dismissed.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I crossed to my station and felt <em>her</em> eyes on me, watching.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would need to talk to Kira. She did the scheduling. To be dismissed from my shift, I&rsquo;d need to go through Kira&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;strong, fiery Kira.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt paralyzed. It&rsquo;s how Hera had made me feel. Cornered, paralyzed, tongue-tied. Defeated before I began, began anything. Aware that she was already irritated with me, aware because I could read it in her, feel it in her. Aware because I could hear it from her too&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;she would spit the words. &ldquo;<em>You can&rsquo;t be relied on for anything, except to aggravate me. I can rely on you to stress me out.&rdquo;</em> She&rsquo;d focus her quietly blazing, stone hard eyes on me. Her jaw immovably set, her lips thinly pressed in her tension. Calmly angry. All systems nominal. This is how she was. This is how Hera was.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God help me if I needed to ask for something out of the ordinary. Forget about wanting anything. &lsquo;Want&rsquo; was a valid reason for nothing, ever. &lsquo;Like&rsquo; even less so. &lsquo;Like&rsquo; was stupid, &lsquo;like&rsquo; was spoiled. &lsquo;Want&rsquo; was desire, &lsquo;want&rsquo; was selfish, &lsquo;want&rsquo; was wrong. &lsquo;Need&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;now <em>&lsquo;need&rsquo;</em> I could maybe make a case for. A good one&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it would have to be airtight. If I could sufficiently argue my case <em>before </em>I asked the question, maybe my petition would be granted. <em>Maybe.</em> Hera was all rage and no reason&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;frequently even my most careful arranging of logic wouldn&rsquo;t work, and it would be time to run.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguing my case required me to draw breath, gather my courage, unstick my lips, look her in the eye, speak, speak up, speak clearly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would need to walk over to Kira, look her in the eye, address her in the appropriately respectful tone of voice, argue my case, make my request. Speak up, speak clearly.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And maybe, I hoped, maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t need to. Maybe my face would make the case for me, my haggard, tired face. If I looked tired enough maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t have to convince her of my need. Tired was valid.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tired was also careless, unprofessional. She might be angry with me for showing up for my shift looking like shit. I&rsquo;d tried not to. I&rsquo;m good with makeup. But my hair doesn&rsquo;t always cooperate.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, logically I&rsquo;d make her angry regardless, one way or the other. Might as well just&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;go do it. Go talk to her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I faced my duty station and took a deep breath, gathered myself. I turned, ready to walk over to her&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and found that she&rsquo;d come to me, she was standing at my shoulder.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe, what are you doing here?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>oh it&rsquo;s my hair, I look like shit, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m sorry</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was I doing here? What did she mean by <em>that?</em> That was not a question I&rsquo;d programmed myself to answer. The values were hard coded in. I work in Ops, it&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock, I&rsquo;m here.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t have words for her. I stared at her, trying to read what she was specifically unhappy about.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Agathe, honey.&rdquo;</em> She pressed a hand to my shoulder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>huh?</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice was soft. Her eyes were warm, not hot. She&rsquo;d called me &lsquo;honey&rsquo;.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t angry. My eyes instantly watered, I was so relieved.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that. Now the heat entered her eyes and they hardened. She spoke with low-voiced intensity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe, <em>I swear to you</em> if I&rsquo;d seen him hurting you I would have killed him on the spot.&rdquo;&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>oh my god</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>oh my god</em>
    <br>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d forgotten. I&rsquo;d been so scared of her I&rsquo;d forgotten. I looked past her&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I could see the little sort of walled off area, the floor&hellip; <em>oh my god</em> &hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized I wasn&rsquo;t breathing. My hand was over my mouth. My neck was so tense. I froze like a small animal again.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kira was watching me. Watching my face.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wanna know how I feel, Agathe? I feel like <em>hunting him down.</em> I don&rsquo;t know what he did to you, but <em>I know he did something </em>and he hurt you and now I want to hunt him down and <em>kill him.</em>&rdquo;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>goddess of the hunt</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why hadn&rsquo;t she felt that way about Justin? He&rsquo;d killed Justin. Less directly, but still&hellip;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put a hand to my cheek, warmly, like a mother would.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have a very good night, did you? I don&rsquo;t see how you could have, after what he did to you, whatever it was. You don&rsquo;t need to be here, Agathe. I&rsquo;m dismissing you from duty. I want you to go take care of yourself, get some rest. I&rsquo;m ordering you back to your quarters. Listen to me, Agathe&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;please, take all the time you need. Don&rsquo;t come back until you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>What?</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;d been convinced of my need. I&rsquo;d made a case for it and persuaded her. How had I done that? What were my arguments? It wasn&rsquo;t my exhaustion. It wasn&rsquo;t my appearance. What had been my winning argument?
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>It was what he had done.</em><em>What he&rsquo;d done</em> had made my case for me. What he&rsquo;d done had been bad enough to win it. And she didn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;d done.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Had</em> it been that bad? Bad enough to win my case?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Had it really been that bad?</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d fucked me. He&rsquo;d fucked me so good. He&rsquo;d fucked me for Kira. I looked at her.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Kira, he wants you, I know how he burns for you. He showed it to me last night, he fucked me, for you, he fucked me with his desire for you, his need for you.</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so messed up. I was so fatigued. I didn&rsquo;t know up from down. Kira wasn&rsquo;t mad at me. Hera wasn&rsquo;t there. He&rsquo;d fucked me. He&rsquo;d fucked me over. I was crying. I didn&rsquo;t feel it starting, but I noticed the tears rolling down my cheeks, I heard my shaky breathing. I was crying in Ops. I was crying in front of Kira, in front of everyone. Everyone could see. I hate to be seen crying. Oh God.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d said he would break me. He&rsquo;d said he would break me in Ops. Well, it was complete. I was broken, broken in Ops.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This wasn&rsquo;t what he&rsquo;d meant, though, was it?</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t meant <em>all this</em>, through to now, he couldn&rsquo;t have. Nobody could. I was overthinking it. People always say I think too much, I overthink.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d called him a <em>&lsquo;sick fuck&rsquo;. This</em> would make him a sick fuck. All this. Through to now.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would make last night&hellip; Okay, no. Just no. <em>NO.</em> No fucking way he could have orchestrated it all the way through to this moment. He didn&rsquo;t know me. He didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> know me. He hadn&rsquo;t known what he was touching. He hadn&rsquo;t known what he was fucking.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the doctor knew. Julian. I needed to go to him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I need Julian,&rdquo; I whispered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kira hit her combadge. &ldquo;Kira to Bashir. Where are you?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice. &ldquo;In the infirmary, Major.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squeezed my shoulder. &ldquo;Stay there. I&rsquo;m sending Agathe to you.&rdquo;
