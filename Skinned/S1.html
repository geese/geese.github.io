   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed to reschedule my initial appointment with you. You&rsquo;re pretty solidly booked up, so it&rsquo;ll be a while before I can come in to talk to you. I&rsquo;m certainly not the only person with problems. The good thing is, I can use the time to extend my account, write you a second one, give you more context. So that&rsquo;s what this is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I wrote the first account, I believed it would be my last&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;so I simply ended it in the post-coital embrace of Dukat/Apollo. <em>&lsquo;I just let him fucking hold me.&rsquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I knew he wasn&rsquo;t Apollo. He wasn&rsquo;t exactly a god, even if he&rsquo;d brought me to orgasm multiple times in foreplay alone, addling my mind just enough to regard him as equal to a god. No, he was a mortal Cardassian man who drifted into a deep comfortable sleep after sex. We weren&rsquo;t <em>in</em> his bed, in the conventional manner. The bed was roomy enough for two people to lie across it fucking, as we&rsquo;d done, and afterwards lie across it sleeping. I figured his accommodations were more generous than those enjoyed by the other men on his ship.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed had a blanket on it, maybe two, I wasn&rsquo;t sure, but we weren&rsquo;t under them and indeed we didn&rsquo;t need any. I&rsquo;d heard that Cardassians prefer a warmer environment relative to other species, such as humans and Bajorans. It&rsquo;s true! It was warm in his quarters, wow. I didn&rsquo;t mind. My own favorite way to feel is &lsquo;not cold&rsquo;. Where I grew up on Earth&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not so far from Starfleet Headquarters but further south&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it doesn&rsquo;t get very cold. In winter the temperature is usually moderate with no snow. Summers can get very hot. My favorite feeling was to walk outside knowing it wouldn&rsquo;t be cold and I wouldn&rsquo;t need a jacket. That&rsquo;s what Dukat&rsquo;s quarters felt like. Warm enough not to need a jacket or a blanket. Warm enough to be naked and comfortable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <em>he</em> was comfortable. I&rsquo;d rolled him off me as he lost consciousness, having had enough foresight to know I&rsquo;d suffocate if I got myself trapped under all his sleeping weight. So now he lay on his back, looking every bit as menacing as any beautiful sleeping child would. I mean, a sleeping Dukat, eyes closed, was something to see. His handsome face was the mildest of blank slates. You wouldn&rsquo;t know he was capable of harming, or terrifying, or thrilling anyone at all. If you were his mother you could only gaze at him lovingly and kiss him softly. Which I did. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. I touched my lips to his forehead, to his cheeks, to his eye ridges, softly, tenderly. I&rsquo;d somehow crossed into a parallel dimension of serenity with this sleeping man. What a gift.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay softly cuddled into his side, my leg draped over one of his, my fingers idly strolling his rolling landscape of scales and ridges, looking, thinking. Thinking about his mother. Had he had one growing up? Had she watched him sleep when he was small? Did Cardassians do that? Had she checked on him in the night and pulled his blankets over him if he had kicked them off in his sleep? Had she blessed his cheeks with her love?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would Kira do if she got to watch him sleep? Would she just kill him? She was so tough. She&rsquo;d be the type to fashion a meticulously designed shiv&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a deadly one that she could sheathe and stash in her vagina, that she could deftly sneak out in the event she got into a really tight scrape and needed to cut a dude. But&hellip;Dukat wouldn&rsquo;t have made it that far with her. She&rsquo;d have ended him the moment he&rsquo;d kidnapped her. But then&hellip;he wouldn&rsquo;t have had the opportunity to do that either. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to seduce her with his eyes across a lonely cocktail table, snake-charming her into licking his throat and sucking on him while he dry-humped her against a wall. She&rsquo;d never even have been at that table, never have sought refuge on a dark balcony with a drink, things would never have gotten that far&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;never have gotten anywhere&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;nothing would ever have started in Ops with <em>her</em>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered how Kira had looked at me after I&rsquo;d bitten him and he&rsquo;d discovered I was hot for him, then heard my name, then noticed me. She&rsquo;d looked annoyed with me. I was sensitive to that look. I struggle to maintain self-confidence in the presence of strong women. I constantly worry that they&rsquo;re mad at me, annoyed with me for speaking, for saying the wrong thing, irritated with me for <em>being wrong</em>. Kira is especially intimidating to me. Her eyes can be so fierce, so fiery. Her voice as well. She scares me when she&rsquo;s angry. But not to the degree that my own mother scared me while I was growing up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned my mother in my last account. I called her the &ldquo;dominant scary&rdquo; parent. I don&rsquo;t feel right talking about her so candidly, about my own mother. I don&rsquo;t usually have good things to report. It makes me feel guilty to say anything, like I&rsquo;m exposing her, betraying her. I find it easier to assign her a different title. I think of her as Hera, another god&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a goddess&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;from ancient Greek mythology.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera was married to Zeus, the father of Apollo. She was a jealous, rage-filled goddess, never forgetting an injury or a slight, real or imagined. She tormented and punished the guilty and blameless alike. The &lsquo;guilty&rsquo; would be her husband Zeus. The &lsquo;blameless&rsquo; were all the goddesses, nymphs, and mortals he either seduced or raped, both before and throughout his marriage to her&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;as well as the children he sired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these goddesses was Leto. She bore him Apollo and his twin sister Artemis, goddess of the hunt. I could see Kira as the Artemis to Dukat&rsquo;s Apollo. Kira would of course differ in the fact that she doesn&rsquo;t reject men, but she would absolutely <em>never </em>be sexual with Apollo. As for me, if my mother was Hera, then my own relations with Apollo wouldn&rsquo;t be problematic.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I digress. Leto was blameless. She was already pregnant when Zeus married Hera. But Hera was all rage and no reason, making Leto&rsquo;s life worse than difficult. She banished Leto from her home and sent the dragon Python to chase her all over the earth, forcing her to wander without shelter until finally landing on a desolate rocky island where she gave birth to her twins.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was Zeus-like, he had affairs. Hera was angry and bitter and hated him. They fought. They screamed obscenities at each other. Hera threw pots and pans at him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my father no longer lived with us, Hera turned her rage on me. Often it was loud. She would yell at me, percussively, violently. When her face darkened to a particular shade, I knew I should run&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;although invariably I&rsquo;d end up in a corner somewhere where she&rsquo;d catch me and seize my hair angrily in her taloned hand, yelling demonically through clenched teeth, through the rage that distorted her face.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her quiet anger was worse. When she was calm, I knew it was only the eye of a storm. She was like Dukat in his prerecorded warnings to the Bajoran workers. The threat was in the spaces <em>between </em>her actions, in what she looked like she was <em>about </em>to do. I learned to read her tension, read how she held her body, to read her face, read her voice. This was to guard myself. When I was six or seven years old, after my father had moved away, Hera began to slap my face out of nowhere. Out of the clear blue sky. Usually she&rsquo;d say, <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t appreciate your tone of voice. I am your mother.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slapped hard. I can hear it resonate in my head. I can feel it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;sharp, sudden, painful, shocking. I learned to always read her and try to apologize very quickly if I detected a surge of danger&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>don&rsquo;t hit me I&rsquo;m sorry</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she&rsquo;s Hera.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is upsetting to me. I need to take a moment and visit a more soothing reality. I cuddled into Dukat&rsquo;s side while he slept. I wound my leg around his, I pressed my nipples to his ribs. My hand roved languorously over his body, recalling the pleasures of his textures to my mind. His scales. Oh god, his scales. I loved his most special place, where he was scaled, where his treasure met his body, where a human would have hair. I&rsquo;d held my face there, licking him, nuzzling him. He was fragranced there. I can&rsquo;t describe it with any words I know. Maybe there&rsquo;s a Cardassian word for it, like &lsquo;<em>agat&rsquo;</em>. Well, like <em>&lsquo;dukat&rsquo;.</em> It was him, it was his fragrance. I loved knowing it, knowing that under his uniform, under his armor, he was <em>fragranced</em> and I knew it by heart. His beautiful bed of scales meandered a little ways down the length of his treasure before demurely tapering out into sweetness, smoothness, so quiet, so good to me. I caressed him in this place while he slept, my fingertips memorizing his texture. They&rsquo;d need to remind my tongue later, when it would think of him, think of licking him. I didn&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d ever get to lick him again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered the last time&hellip;well&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know if it was the last time, the last hug ever. It&rsquo;s the last time I remember being watched by Hera while I hugged my father. She&rsquo;d watch me when I was with him, listen while we spoke. I had to answer to her later, for everything. Everything I&rsquo;d said. Everything I&rsquo;d done. She would question me. And then she would tell me the specific reasons why my words to him were wrong, why my hugs around him were wrong. <em>&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;</em> was wrong. I would say <em>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rsquo;</em> so maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t hit me. When she wasn&rsquo;t spitting direct criticism, her messages were unspoken or intimated. I would read her face, her mood. I would read the subtext in her reminders of how horrible my father was to her. I&rsquo;d hear the unspoken. <em>You should never say anything nice about him, let alone to him, you shouldn&rsquo;t love him, because that means you think I&rsquo;m dirt, I&rsquo;m just a piece of shit. And I am your mother.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember I hugged my father out in the hall, in the courthouse, where my parents divorced, where they returned for many custody hearings. My father was there, Hera was there, attorneys were there, strangers were there. I hugged him stiffly because she was watching. I don&rsquo;t know if my arms were around him or not, I don&rsquo;t remember. I hope they were. I loved him. I loved him always, even after I stopped saying the words. I hope I at least showed it that day by putting my arms around him, even if my body was stiff.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dream of hugs. Dark, enveloping hugs. My face to a chest. I dreamed once of a boy in high school, Chris A., the older brother of one of the jerks in my own grade. Chris felt safe to me because he was older and ignored me. Most boys weren&rsquo;t safe. They ridiculed me for being flat-chested. Like I wasn&rsquo;t worthy to be sexually objectified. If they could&rsquo;ve seen inside my mind they would have known I&rsquo;d be fun. <em>&lsquo;Fun&rsquo; </em>like I was for Dukat. They liked my ass. A friend of mine told me. I&rsquo;d been leaning over a table and the guys had eyed my ass approvingly, making remarks. It was nice to know. It was nice to know that <em>some </em>part of my body might interest someone in fucking me, because I sure wanted to be fucked. Not by one of the boys, though. I wanted my teachers. They were men. They needed to shave.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d dreamed I stood on the path leading to my house. Hera waited at the door, watching. Suddenly Chris stood before me. Chris was tall, much taller than I was. My head reached his chest. He usually wore a soft black long-sleeved shirt with a hood. He was tall beckoning darkness. My face descended onto his chest like water over the falls, into the depths of the dark. He held me. He held me and I knew Hera watched. I knew that as long as he held me, I wouldn&rsquo;t need to enter the house. I began kissing him on his chest, moving up to his neck, to his lips. I was aroused, I wanted him. As long as he stood where he was, Hera wouldn&rsquo;t see my desire for him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his body shielded it from her view. Nothing would rip me away. I carried that dream with me after I awoke. I still hold it in my depths. It was safety, it was arousal.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my caresses aroused Dukat, my fingers awakening his sweetest place. I felt him harden under my hand, and he stirred. It excited me to feel his hardness growing like a healthy stalk in the fertile soil of our intertwined warmth and softness, in the belly of our naked togetherness. I let my body flow over his, like the water over the falls, my face into his neck, his fragranced neck. I found him and eased him inside me, kissing his neck. I let his body slowly break mine into song. It almost made me come just to have him inside me. It&rsquo;s not so much the physical stimulation&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;just being inside isn&rsquo;t generally enough for me, I&rsquo;m more responsive to the rubbing&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the kind he&rsquo;s so good at&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he had rubbed me with his hand, he had rubbed me with his treasure&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but his being inside me was rubbing me emotionally, he stimulated me on a deeper level by being inside me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;just the thought of him inside me makes my belly flutter so madly.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were so smooth together, so slick and so quiet. I felt his special secret scales as I slid over him, stroking his length, swallowing him, serenely, sleepily. He opened drowsy eyes and smiled at me, wrapping me in strong ridged arms, holding me, breathing steadily, softly, warmly. He glowed when he smiled. He was sleepy and came inside me again. I loved how he felt as he came, his pressing into me, his gentle spasms, his muted groans. I wanted to hold this forever. This felt like love to me.
