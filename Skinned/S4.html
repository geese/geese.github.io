<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing Julian had told me yesterday was that I should &ldquo;eat something and rest.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d eaten something. But he could see I hadn&rsquo;t rested.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe, didn&rsquo;t you sleep at all last night? I should have given you medication to help you. I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t. Forgive me. Tonight you&rsquo;re taking something.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just turning to go get what he wanted to give me, when he caught a second glimpse of my eyes. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t see my eyes, so I can&rsquo;t name what he saw in them, but I know my intentions were swirling wildly. Pleading and hesitating. Beckoning and withdrawing. Whatever that looked like to him, it stopped him in his tracks.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed to talk to him. I needed to show him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locking eyes with him, I spoke so only he could hear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Julian, I need to talk to you somewhere private.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced around at the room. The only other person visible was a Bajoran nurse.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed him around a curve to the other side of a workstation, to a bed somewhat isolated from the others. He drew a curtain, hiding us from the rest of the room.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was good.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I touched my fingertips lightly to my upper chest. I focused on his eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I need&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I need one of your shirt things. Something I can open. I have to show you something.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. &ldquo;Wait here, I&rsquo;ll get you one.&rdquo;&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought it to me and stepped around the curtain while I took down my top and removed my undershirt, and yeah, the bra too. What the hell, he&rsquo;s a doctor. It was just my body, my bruised body. The shirt thing opened in the front. I felt cold, the way I always do when I need to undress and wear this kind of thing. Exposed, too. But that was the point. I drew it closed as much as I could and wrapped my arms around myself, trying to feel warmer.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Julian.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped into my space again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I searched his eyes. Soft as they were, this would be so difficult.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is it, Agathe?&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes were so open, so dark, so warm.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to release the shirt thing at the top. Revealing the upper part of the damage, the first. Watching his eyes. They were a mirror window, reflecting what he saw while also revealing his feelings about what he saw. They told me he hoped the damage didn&rsquo;t extend lower down, but he knew that it did. Knew it because I couldn&rsquo;t speak. Knew it because I was uncrossing my arms, allowing the shirt thing to fall open as it willed. Knew it because he was looking at my chest, my breasts. Looking at Apollo&rsquo;s passion and artistry.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hissed in a sharp breath. <em>&ldquo;Agathe!&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching gently, carefully, with warm fingers. Sensitively.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe.&rdquo; Looking in my eyes, pained. &ldquo;<em>What happened?</em>&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching me struggle for words. Eyes brimming with color, cashmere concern.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his hands to my upper arms, holding me behind my shoulders. He was very close to me. He probably shouldn&rsquo;t stand so close to me. He should probably keep more distance between us. Professional distance, doctor-patient distance. But I don&rsquo;t mind when he crosses that line a little. He&rsquo;s so gentle it never feels like a breach. It never feels wrong. Please don&rsquo;t say anything to him about it.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dropped my eyes to his chest.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barely whispered. <em>&ldquo;I was with Dukat.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needed me to repeat that. I did so, more coherently.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Dukat?</em> When?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you went to your quarters.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I did. But then I went out. He found me.&rdquo;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He <em>found you?</em> What the hell was he doing here?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;finding me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, my God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed at a loss for words for a few moments.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where did he find you?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At Quark&rsquo;s, upstairs. I just&hellip;I wanted a drink. I didn&rsquo;t want to be alone.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How did he know you were there?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;somehow he knew to ask Quark about me. You&rsquo;ve seen me there, I go every week. He just&hellip;he just got lucky. He paid Quark to let him know if I showed. And then he&hellip;<em>found</em> me. Upstairs.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is that where you were when he&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;did this?&rdquo;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>slamming into me against the wall, grinding his hungry cock against me, I&rsquo;d wanted him, he&rsquo;d felt so good, I would have dropped to my knees for him, he could have had me right there on the balcony, he could have had me in my mouth so hard</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe? Did he do this to you upstairs?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At first.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At first&hellip;where else?&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable question. I didn&rsquo;t want to answer it.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe? Where else?&rdquo; I felt him connect a dot. &ldquo;Where else did he take you?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>not in my mouth&hellip;he didn&rsquo;t take me in my mouth</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to slow this down. This was&hellip;a lot.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Where did he take you, Agathe?&rdquo;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>to his chariot&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he would do it. He took me&hellip;to his ship.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;His ship&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he took you&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;directly? Transported?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded. <em>He&rsquo;d held me, I&rsquo;d seen orange, he&rsquo;d taken my hand and led me to his quarters&hellip;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did anyone see this?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So no one knew you were with him?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quark knew. I mean, if he&rsquo;d thought about it. He heard us from below. I mean&hellip;&rdquo;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What did he hear?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>how could I explain what he&rsquo;d heard?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We were&hellip;making noises. We were&hellip;&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have words.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Was he forcing himself on you?&rdquo;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>maybe&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;no&hellip;not exactly.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe.&rdquo; Firmly gripping my arms. Lowering his voice.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Did he force himself on you?&rdquo;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up at his eyes. They were so close to mine. They were&hellip;my God they were beautiful&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Of course he&rsquo;d forced himself on me. Of course he had.</em> <em>Of course he had.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth crashed over me in waves out of Julian&rsquo;s eyes, the absence of menace in his eyes was the truth, the open warmth of his eyes, it was truth, it was truth, <em>of course he&rsquo;d forced himself on me.</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to tell him, I came here to tell him. I dropped my eyes again, afraid, so afraid. I needed him to stay.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Julian.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw my hands had gone to his chest. I think they wanted to bond with him. I watched my hands, I spoke to his chest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>don&rsquo;t leave me don&rsquo;t leave me</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Julian, he had me.&rdquo;</em> I whispered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oh my god, this hurt
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just say it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;He had me. He came inside me, Julian&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his hands to my wrists. He held them. His hands were warm. Mine clung to his chest. I watched them. I watched my hands, his hands.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathed so close to me. If I&rsquo;d looked up now I could have kissed him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My God. He raped you.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>don&rsquo;t say it like that&nbsp;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. No, he didn&rsquo;t. He was just rough. I wanted it like that. I <em>wanted</em> it, Julian.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convince him. <em>&ldquo;I wanted it, Julian, I wanted it rough!&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, Agathe, you didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;you didn&rsquo;t want it like that. <em>He raped you.&rdquo;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe, Agathe. <em>Listen to me.</em>&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In emphasis, he squeezed my wrists more intensely, the motion pulling my hands against him more firmly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>He kidnapped you.</em> No one knew where you were. He had already hurt you. You were terrified. You had nowhere to go. <em>You had no choice.</em> You told yourself you wanted it so you could survive it. But you didn&rsquo;t want it. It&rsquo;s not your fault, Agathe. <em>He raped you.</em>&rdquo;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Had he?</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was true that he&rsquo;d kidnapped me. There&rsquo;d been nothing I could do. I couldn&rsquo;t resist, I couldn&rsquo;t get away, I couldn&rsquo;t fight him. I&rsquo;d figured he&rsquo;d kill me if I tried. I remembered thinking I&rsquo;d die&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;or something&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;my subconscious belief was <em>&lsquo;die&rsquo;</em> but I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to accept it. I remembered thinking that if I gave in, <em>&lsquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t kill me to die&rsquo;.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered touching him, kissing his collarbones, wanting to stop.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to go on, to have sex. I&rsquo;d wanted him to hold me, to comfort me, help me, pause, hold. In desperation I&rsquo;d put my arms around him. I&rsquo;d wanted to hold him and <em>&lsquo;sink into the warm night&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what was that if not a metaphor for escape&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;if not death&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;oh God I <em>had </em>been terrified, more terrified than I&rsquo;d known. I&rsquo;d realized I was <em>&lsquo;more alone than alone&rsquo;.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My one recourse, my one retreat, had been to advance&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to have sex with him. To have sex with him and like it, want it, need it. So I&rsquo;d done it. <em>God help me, I&rsquo;d loved it.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d helped me along by pulling me onto his lap so I could grind on his dick and come in his arms. <em>My God, that had been good. </em>And he had been holding me. And I had gathered his face into my neck.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>but rape?</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>if that had been rape I didn&rsquo;t want to know it.</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t lick the throat of a rapist. I wouldn&rsquo;t grind and come in the lap of a rapist. I wouldn&rsquo;t lick and kiss and suck the beautiful treasure of a rapist. I wouldn&rsquo;t crave for him to take me in my mouth, a rapist. He wouldn&rsquo;t kiss me and taste my <em>&lsquo;agat&rsquo;</em> and probe me with his tongue and nibble me. A rapist. He wouldn&rsquo;t fuck me so good, a rapist, he wouldn&rsquo;t fuck my pain away. I wouldn&rsquo;t want him back. I wouldn&rsquo;t want him to come and fuck me more, fuck me hard, a rapist. I wouldn&rsquo;t, I <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> want that. He wasn&rsquo;t a rapist. He didn&rsquo;t rape me.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;</em> I moaned.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urging me. &ldquo;Agathe, it&rsquo;s not your fault, it&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;&hellip;no&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispering. <em>&ldquo;&hellip;he raped you&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;Rape&rsquo; </em>was too far. Julian was going too far. He had to stop. He was hurting me. Julian would never hurt me, never, <em>he would never hurt me.</em> But now he was going too far.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to look up, look into his beautiful dark open eyes, look and plead with him, <em>stop, stop, Julian, stop.</em> But his eyes were danger to me. His eyes were truth. If I looked in his eyes I would see what he was telling me, I would <em>see it.</em> No menace in his eyes, the truth would wash over me, it would wash me away.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t look in his eyes, look at his hands, look at his chest.</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would die if my head wasn&rsquo;t on his chest now, his chest was safety, I had to reach it. I tried to reach it, he was close to me already but needed to be closer. I opened my knees to make room, to bring him closer. I drew in to him, to touch my head to his chest, a little above my hands, just below his collarbones. He held my wrists. As I pulled in to him my nipples brushed the backs of his hands. I felt him react&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a faint gasp, a slight shudder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Agathe&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We struggled a little, just a little, I was trying to draw closer to him, he was trying to push me back, the opposing forces only pressing my nipples against his hands, more urgently, more pleadingly.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Please, Julian, please,&rdquo; I begged him. Breathing it, <em>&ldquo;Please&hellip;Julian&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t, Agathe,&rdquo; </em>he managed, barely.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>feel my nipples, Julian, feel them, hold me</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;&hellip;please&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew he was feeling them. I moved a little, the barest fraction, just enough that they spoke to him, emphasized themselves to him, he could feel it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but infinitesimal enough that he could have imagined it, I could deny it, I could deny that I knew what I was doing.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>cross the line Julian cross it</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;&hellip;please&hellip;Julian&hellip;please&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave in a little, sighing my name. He gave in, moving closer between my knees, releasing my wrists, taking me in his arms, one arm around my back, holding me tight, the other on my hair, pulling my face to his chest, folding me in to himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Agathe, I shouldn&rsquo;t, I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;</em> he breathed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>yes yes you should&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;cross the line&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;help me forget&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;help me not know</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispering, his breath angry on my hair. <em>&ldquo;How could he hurt you Agathe&hellip;he doesn&rsquo;t deserve to touch you&hellip;someone so beautiful&hellip;Agathe&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m not beautiful&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;you say I am but I&rsquo;m not</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chest was dark. It was safety, it was arousal. I began to breathe faster.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I would suffocate if he didn&rsquo;t take me and make me not know, oh Julian&hellip;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to have him, I had to.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took him, I had him in my head, in my mind. I took him in the dark of my mind, on his chest.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was so easy, so natural. My lips raised themselves to his neck and began kissing him, so dark in his neck, so hidden. I kissed him all over it, my lips tasted his shadow, the shadow under his chin where he shaved, he smelled so good, so clean. I raised my hands to his hair and wove it through my fingers, it was dark, soft. I pulled his face to mine and kissed his lips&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they gave themselves to me, we kissed, our lips so warm together, so wanting, so right.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deepened the kiss, he deepened his hug, he hugged me down onto the bed, onto my back, in his arms, in his kiss. It wasn&rsquo;t this bed, it was a different bed, one we wouldn&rsquo;t fall off of, one we could hide and love in.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bed we were naked, we&rsquo;d never worn clothes, we&rsquo;d never needed any. I was okay with my breasts, he never judged them, he wouldn&rsquo;t even need to touch them, I was so aroused already. He could come in to me, forget my breasts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but if he wanted to touch them, he could&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his touch would never bruise. He could kiss them too, but he could just go ahead and have me, I was so ready for him, <em>he could have me</em>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt with his sensitive fingers, <em>yesssss, </em>testing to be certain I was wet for him, ready for him, he&rsquo;d never proceed until I was ready for him. He was so kind, so good, <em>come in come in&hellip; </em>He felt me with his doctor&rsquo;s hand, his hand that could read my body and whisper to it.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>come in to me Julian&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m ready for you&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;let me make you feel good let me show you&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m wet I&rsquo;m hot I&rsquo;m soft I&rsquo;m open&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;come in, come in</em><br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt his safety, his healing safety, he slid it into me and stroked me with it, <em>ohhhhh</em> so good in me, so wet with me, I savored the length of each sliding stroke, <em>mmmmm </em>he healed, with his hard safety <em>ohhhh yessss, Julian</em>, <em>Julian&hellip;</em>his name was soft, his name was care, I breathed it to his wet healing strokes, <em>ahhhhhh Juuuliannnn</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>his weight so light, so lovely on me, so safe on me</em><br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body heat increased with his effort, his ministrations in me, so earnestly he moved, he helped me, he helped me not know anything, not know anymore. He was hot, he perspired, his sheen was beautiful. He was light he was clean he was care, he cared for me. I fingered the hair on his head, it was damp, he was sweating. I played with his dark wet curls while he continued urging and pushing his safety inside me, staying with me, caring for me, healing me <em>deep</em>. I brought my mouth to his jaw and kissed it and tasted his gentle sheen, his gloss. I pulled his lips to mine and kissed him as he cared for me, <em>mmmmm, </em>he was hot, he was hard, he was <em>good</em>.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I heard him rasp my name, for real, in a deeply voiced whisper&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it happened&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not in my mind. He moved my head back a little, gently by my hair, so he could see my face. I looked, I glimpsed his eyes for a moment&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;enough to see beauty but not to see truth&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he brought both hands to my face and tilted it up to his, he pressed his lips to my forehead, warmly, hungrily. He didn&rsquo;t kiss, he stopped short of a kiss. He held my face against his lips, trembling, breathing shakily through his nose, not kissing me. He broke this off and wrapped his arms around me again, tightly. He laid his cheek on the top of my head, I felt his uneven breaths on my hair. My face was in his neck, my lips on his skin now, it was my turn to somehow not kiss him, <em>oh God how</em>, I felt his dark shadow, it was warm it was scratchy, oh God how would I not do this, not kiss him. We were hugging, my arms around him now, clinging, we pressed ourselves to each other, both trembling, both resisting, not kissing, somehow not kissing.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lips disobeyed me, whispering against his shadow. <em>&ldquo;&hellip;please&hellip;please Julian&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing into my hair. <em>&ldquo;&hellip;no Agathe&hellip;we can&rsquo;t, we can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I know it believe me I know it</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I don&rsquo;t want you to cross the line&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;you wouldn&rsquo;t be Julian</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>please cross it don&rsquo;t cross it&nbsp;</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know he shouldn&rsquo;t hug me and stroke my hair. He shouldn&rsquo;t whisper my name as he does. I know he shouldn&rsquo;t care for me in this way, I should never lead him to press assurances of his safety inside me as I want him to. Who would he be if he did that? Wouldn&rsquo;t it break me if he wasn&rsquo;t Julian?
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>then let&rsquo;s just stay&hellip;let&rsquo;s just stay&hellip;let&rsquo;s just breathe here together&hellip;let&rsquo;s just be safe</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was holding myself so close to him that my soreness finally reminded me what I had been showing to him in the first place. I pulled away from him, enough to expose my breasts to his eyes again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Julian.&rdquo; I looked down at myself, then up at him. He understood the indicating gesture, briefly shutting his eyes in a quiet grimace. One of his regenerators was within reach on a surface near the bed&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his hand fumbled for it and closed on it. He activated it and began tending to my damage. I was thinking it was too bad I didn&rsquo;t have one of those, I could probably do this myself&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;though it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same, not nearly. His other hand held me behind my shoulder, his forehead almost rested on mine, his breathing pulsed peacefully over me. I let myself float in his quietness as he ministered to me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sensed that neither of us wanted the repair to be entirely finished. But he&rsquo;s a thorough man and I&rsquo;m intelligent, even if I easily lose my mind. One of us had to cut us loose. I&rsquo;d momentarily glanced past my breasts, past his hands&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d seen his pants&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it seemed the cutting would fall to me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length he dropped the device onto the bed at my side. His newly free hand warmly enveloped the nearest breast and now he did rest his forehead on mine. &ldquo;Is it feeling better?&rdquo; He stroked his thumb over my nipple, slowly, a soft lingering tug, just one, one stroke, one tug, just one brimming expression of intimate caring, no more, no further.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; I breathed. &ldquo;Thank you, Julian.&rdquo;
