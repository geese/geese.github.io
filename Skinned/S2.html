   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had to end at last. Time and tide for no man stay. The sun must cross the sky each day. We had to part.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beamed us back to the station, this time outside Quark&rsquo;s on the lower level. It was after closing time, the wee hours of the morning. I guessed it might have been about three o&rsquo;clock. If so, I&rsquo;d be due in Ops in five hours. So much for a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Now I really didn&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d make it through the day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least no one would witness my &lsquo;walk of shame&rsquo;. I allowed him to escort me back to my quarters. Of course I knew that wasn&rsquo;t gallantry on his part. He was obtaining information, my location, where to find me. I knew that. I chose to show him. I wanted him to know where I lived. I didn&rsquo;t care if that was unwise. I&rsquo;d have him in my bed in a heartbeat if that&rsquo;s what he wanted. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him. Not anymore. I was only afraid to part ways, to see his departing back. I began to feel alone before he had gone. I was afraid to be with myself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stepped through the door into my quarters, sorely aware that I lacked technical knowhow in being an adult about this. I&rsquo;m not a one-night-stand kind of girl. I&rsquo;m far more active in mind than in practice. I knew, I knew better than to confuse sex with love. I knew. But I was already beginning to feel hollow, afraid I might cry. Shit. Would I never be able to deal with anything, ever?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Would I ever hear my name in his voice again? He had my name, he had it so good. His voice was so rich and deep, so male, so familiar. I loved him inside me. Why couldn&rsquo;t his holding me be the end of everything?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to teleport my emotions to a chair across the room, to detach it all from my eyes, so I wouldn&rsquo;t powerlessly bare my weak heart to him when I turned to look at him. I needed to feel like I was whole, like I wasn&rsquo;t crumbling to pieces. Shit. What had he done to me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned. This was ridiculous. He was just a man standing in the doorway. Nothing more, nothing less.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come kiss me goodbye, Agat.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to him. Just a few steps. He took my chin and held my face the way he&rsquo;d held it in Ops, on the floor. But he held it gently this time, only firmly enough to hold me in place as he leaned in to my lips. I closed my eyes, memorizing as much of him as I could, storing his pattern in my heart. After he broke the kiss he brought his mouth to my ear and murmured, &ldquo;I had fun. I&rsquo;ll look for you when I&rsquo;m here again.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of his breath tickled my ear as he strode down the corridor and turned the corner.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Fun</em>.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.
    <br><br><br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I hadn&rsquo;t died. I&rsquo;d made it back. Back to my own surroundings, back to my stuff. And if I was honest&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;well&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;at this moment a certain physical sensation was more bothersome to me than any itching of the soul I may have suffered earlier, craving his return. I had let the man release himself in me, twice. Gravity was not my friend right now. I would need another shower.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated the sight of my face, let alone my naked body, in the bathroom mirror. The eyes looking back at me reminded me of Julian&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;d seen me in the infirmary. <em>Holy shit.</em> What had happened to me? I looked pale, gaunt, haunted. Dark circles under my eyes. This kid Louie had made fun of those years ago. In school, when I was about ten years old. My life had been sectioned and distributed between Hera and my father, unevenly but scheduled, prearranged, court ordered. Every other weekend with him, plus every other holiday, Tuesday afternoons after school, and three weeks in the summer. Each visit followed by grueling interrogation by Hera, followed by punishment&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;though the interrogation and punishment were court prohibited, rather than ordered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was tired, as a girl, and had year-round dark circles under my eyes. Louie said they were deep. They looked like swimming pools. He could swim in them. Well, I guess he had imagination. He probably wasn&rsquo;t wrong, if those circles had looked anything like the ones I saw now, in the mirror.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d barely eaten yesterday. The doctor had told me to eat.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Oh my God Justin wouldn&rsquo;t be in Ops today.</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no. No, no. I needed him. I needed my friend. I needed someone who knew me.&nbsp;
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Oh, God.</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It finally hit me. I burst. I pressed my hands to my face and cried, in the bathroom. No one would tell me it was wrong. No one would even see. And it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered. I&rsquo;d lost him. I cried for him.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been so easy with Justin. I&rsquo;d felt so free with Justin. He had liked me from the beginning. I&rsquo;d never felt like I needed to be prettier to be friends with him. Never felt like I&rsquo;d tricked him into liking me. He had just liked me. Had he&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;had he <em>like</em> liked me? He might have. Dax might have seen something. She&rsquo;d told me once that we were cute together.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d had a silly nickname for me. He&rsquo;d called me &lsquo;Agatcha&rsquo;, like &lsquo;I gotcha&rsquo;. It was so sweet because it meant he&rsquo;d accepted my name as it is. Me, as I am. <em>Agathe.</em> He&rsquo;d never acted like it was so different, so unusual, so difficult. He&rsquo;d never made a big deal out of it. He&rsquo;d just learned it and used it, called me by it, fashioned a pet name out of it. My actual name. Had that been love? It had felt so good.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered yesterday, mutely watching Dukat across the Ops table, so confident, so in his element, so collaborative, so accepted into our group. He&rsquo;d taken Justin from me. And then he&rsquo;d leveled me and fucked me and planted his flag in me. And <em>he</em> had spoken my name so sweetly.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My chest, my breasts, they were fucked up. The mirror didn&rsquo;t sugarcoat it. His armor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he&rsquo;d been grinding and thrusting on me <em>so hard</em>, <em>I&rsquo;d loved it, I&rsquo;d loved</em> how he&rsquo;d slammed me like that. He&rsquo;d kissed my marks! It had been his first kiss on me. I hadn&rsquo;t felt the pain when I was with him. He&rsquo;d been a detonation on my body, in my body, so powerful, so devastating&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;just as I&rsquo;d wanted him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d lost my awareness of pain. He&rsquo;d fucked the pain away. He&rsquo;d hurt me and then fucked it away.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>how could I hate him and want him and be angry at him and love him</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sobbing now, hands to my face, trying to hide from myself, from the mirror. The doctor. I wanted him. I needed him. I was hurt, I was so hurt. And this fucker&rsquo;s sperm was in me. I needed to go to Julian.
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Okay but first a shower. Come on. Let&rsquo;s get in there.</em>
    <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t make sense, but I was determined to be ready for work in just a few short hours. Less than a few. I was determined to not look like shit. If I took a shower and let my hair air dry while I slept a little, and then got up and drank a fucking strong cup of coffee and put on makeup, then I could look alive and I could go and I could work. I could do it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least if I could sleep a little, maybe I could do it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be able to sleep. Even a little. I wanted to. I didn&rsquo;t want to lie alone in the night, alone with myself, alone awake. I wanted out. Out of myself.
