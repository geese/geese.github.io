    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then, before I left the infirmary, that Julian told me I should seek you out, book a time with you, talk to you. I could tell he was afraid to offend me by suggesting I see a therapist. He needn&rsquo;t have worried. I understand it, from my parents&rsquo; divorce. It was court ordered. I get it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also addressed the matter of contraceptive injections with me. I don&rsquo;t really feel like getting into that, it&rsquo;s personal. But it needed addressing.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t been that active, sexually. As I said, it&rsquo;s more in my head than in practice. Maybe&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no, forget maybe, definitely&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it would be different if I felt more desirable, more alluring. I&rsquo;d be bolder. I&rsquo;d get all that activity out of my head. I&rsquo;d fuck guys. I think I would. Maybe not. Maybe I&rsquo;d still feel too broken even if I felt beautiful enough.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dammit this can be so hard to talk about. Write about.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t tell Julian that I let Dukat walk me to my quarters. I was afraid he would order me to get my quarters reassigned so I couldn&rsquo;t be found so easily. I wouldn&rsquo;t have disagreed with him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t have disputed his rightness. I don&rsquo;t disagree with the things he tells me, that are right. But it&rsquo;s like the smart part of me is outside myself&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;there&rsquo;s the part of me that knows better than the rest of me, knows how to guard me and care for me and look out for me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but the rest of me is where I am, I live <em>in</em> myself, and I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to guard myself because that&rsquo;s hard to do and it hurts, and the wrong things feel so good, and I&rsquo;m weak and I&rsquo;m crying and I&rsquo;m starving and I can&rsquo;t <em>not want</em> what I <em>need</em>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scheduled my initial appointment with you&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the one that&rsquo;s been postponed&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and then took a week or two, maybe more&hellip;several weeks?&hellip;to write my first account. That was much harder to do than I thought it would be. It interfered with my job. I mostly work with software, with the station&rsquo;s systems. Describing that day, just that one day&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>that one night&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>with Dukat&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it stirred things up in me, so many things, things I hadn&rsquo;t known were there. It was almost a second detonation inside me, a second overpowering of myself. I felt alternatingly sad and fucking horny, or both at the same time. I would steal away periodically, to a secret place I&rsquo;ve found on the station, a place where I can&hellip;you know&hellip;<em>help myself out.</em> Release some pressure, some tension, some fucking <em>need.</em> I really hope you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, my daily work is demanding on my mind, it requires that I think clearly, logically, methodically&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but also creatively&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s crucial that I be able to <em>imagine</em>, to make connections between abstract ideas. That&rsquo;s what programming is. I could barely do it. I was burned out. I hardly slept. I felt so raw, so stirred up, so fucked up, such a mess. I wondered if I was doing the right thing, to relive that fucking day,<em> that fucking night</em>, in order to write about it. I still wonder. Whenever I close my eyes I see him, I see Dukat,<em> I see his eyes</em>, I feel him, I feel his scales, I smell his fragrance, I taste him, I want to kiss his little nose ridge, I want to suck his treasure.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that&rsquo;s dumb. I just said how I feel about him. It&rsquo;s obvious how I feel about him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I showed him where my quarters are.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s how I feel about him.
