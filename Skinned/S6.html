    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know when it was, relative to this time I&rsquo;ve been writing about. I don&rsquo;t know.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He visited the station, he came to my quarters, he rang the chime, I said <em>&ldquo;come in&rdquo;.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the door open, I looked, he stood, he stood in the doorway casually.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Was he really there?</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, Agat.&rdquo; He smiled. He glowed when he smiled.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I let out the breath I&rsquo;d been holding, with a smile of my own.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I remembered to welcome.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know if I should move toward him. I felt a little awkward. I felt like I was expected to take my cue from him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped in. He walked directly to me, he took my face in his hands and tipped it back, he brought his lips to mine and kissed me warmly, deeply, reunitingly. My stomach dropped through the floor. <em>Oh my god.</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wound my arms around his flared neck and I kissed him back, receiving him, inviting him, relearning him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>it had been too long</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt my body running warmups, preparing for song.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled off of my lips, holding my face, looking at me, smiling, considering.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come over here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving with controlled enthusiasm, he pulled me to a wall, pushing me against it, not forcefully, just intentionally. Okay, he seemed to be into this, something about backing me into walls, assuming his godlike position in the forefront of my existence, asserting his power over me, watching me bend to his will.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he want me to resist? I didn&rsquo;t want to resist. I was here for it, all of it. Whatever he wanted, I&rsquo;d go with it. Was that too easy? Did he want more of a challenge?
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; he told me with his voice, somehow also with the hot menace in his eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for saying that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think <em>you&rsquo;re</em> beautiful,&rdquo; I returned the compliment. I mean, <em>fuck me now</em>, but that&rsquo;s how I felt about him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed like he was thinking about my words.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do. I really do.&rdquo; <em>Just look at me, I&rsquo;m drinking in the sight of you, my eyes are singing for you.</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes roved over my body, was he drinking me in too? It looked like he approved.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat, take your shirt off for me.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My singing eyes lost their voice for a moment, they were shy.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Take it off. Let me see you.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>so long as he touches me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;if he touches me it&rsquo;ll be okay&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he&rsquo;ll touch me</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a regular shirt, I&rsquo;d been relaxing in my quarters. I pulled it over my head.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at him. The bra, too? Yes, of course. I took it off, dropped it to the floor.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>oh god i&rsquo;m exposed it makes me burn for you please throw me on the bed fuck me now fuck me hard i&rsquo;m skinned for you fuck me</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could he see the nervous beating of my heart? My shallow, tremulous breathing? Did my face look stricken, uncertain?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he liked it.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, Agat.&rdquo; Still smiling.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took my face in his hand again and held it like in Ops. But gently, as when he&rsquo;d said goodbye. He kissed me again, I kissed him back, any part of me that he touched, I would return to him, I would give to him, I wanted to give him <em>myself,</em> I wanted to be taken.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took me with power in his other hand, he took possession of me between my legs, he held me warmly, firmly, I was his to hold, to hold in his strong hand.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I groaned, I pressed into him. Damn, his armor, I&rsquo;d forgotten about that, why was that still on him? I hadn&rsquo;t felt that against my naked breasts before, that was new. I didn&rsquo;t really like it. Oh, well. His hand was doing more to me anyway.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulling off of my lips, a millimeter. &ldquo;Do you like this, Agat? Do you?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;oh god yes&hellip;<em>yesssss</em>&hellip;please don&rsquo;t stop! <em>I&rsquo;m yours,</em> <em>I&rsquo;m yours&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against my lips. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours&hellip;&rdquo;</em> moaning into him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed me, he wove his tongue into my mouth, it was delicious, we tongued each other, I wanted him to invade, invade me everywhere, take me, take me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was rubbing me, his thumb in the right spot this time, not like on the floor, <em>ohhhhhhhh god don&rsquo;t let me pass out before he can open me and push himself in and fuck me with his treasure</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thumb, his thumb would kill me, <em>oh fuck,</em> be hard, be hard for me, I needed to grind, I needed to swallow, I needed him to throw me down and shove my legs open, demand them open, demand them, breach me, <em>breach me hard, breach me wet, hold me down</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing on his wrist, it chirped at him. The communicator. Whatever the hell it was. It needed his attention, it got it, he looked at it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t smile at it. He rolled his eyes.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at me again. Sighing with impatience, shaking his head.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a problem. I&rsquo;m needed back. I have to leave.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>had that been translated correctly?</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed his hands on the wall to either side of me, above my head, looking down at me intently. Not very far down, I&rsquo;m not that much shorter than he is.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised my eyes to his, to his menacing beauty.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat. I&rsquo;ll be back. I don&rsquo;t know when. But I will be. I want you to think about me while I&rsquo;m gone. Will you do that for me?&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>unless you can tell me how not to</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I will think about you.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I will think of nothing else. You are everything. I want you.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling. &ldquo;Good, Agat. I&rsquo;ll see you.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning, walking to the door, letting it open, stepping through, striding away.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d never touched my breasts.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d only watched me skin myself. He&rsquo;d only looked. He&rsquo;d only <em>seen.</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving me when I&rsquo;m skinned is not a great time to leave me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn&rsquo;t know that. He didn&rsquo;t mean it. He doesn&rsquo;t know me. He doesn&rsquo;t know who he fucked. He doesn&rsquo;t know how I feel, how I fear that someone who sees my breasts won&rsquo;t want me and will leave me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t know it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me like that.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Would he?</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of rolled my body over against the wall, so that I faced it, and then I slammed the side of my fist into it, hard, a number of times, a great number of times. When I&rsquo;d punished my fist enough I sank to my knees on the floor, tucking my head over them, inhaling my hollow huddled darkness.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My god I wanted him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>My god, I wanted my god, my dark and glowing god.</em>
