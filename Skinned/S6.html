   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know when exactly it was, relative to the time that I&rsquo;ve been writing about. It was after Julian had given me your name. And it was after I&rsquo;d finished writing my first account. But which specific day it was, I can&rsquo;t be sure. Maybe that means I tried to put it out of my mind.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He visited the station, he came to my quarters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the chime. I said, &ldquo;Come in&rdquo;.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the door open. I looked. I saw him standing in the doorway, casual, relaxed.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark, handsome.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Was he really there?</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, Agat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled. He glowed when he smiled.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I released the breath I&rsquo;d been holding&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;maybe for weeks I&rsquo;d been holding it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;with a smile of my own.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I remembered to welcome him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know if I should move toward him. I felt a little awkward. I felt like I was expected to take my cue from him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped in. He crossed directly to me, he took my face in his hands and tilted it back, he brought his lips to mine and kissed me warmly, deeply, reunitingly. My stomach dropped through the floor. <em>Oh my god.</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wound my arms around his flared neck and kissed him back, receiving him, inviting him, relearning him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>it had been too long</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt my body running warmups, preparing for song.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew back from my lips, holding my face, looking, smiling, considering.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come over here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animated with controlled enthusiasm, he pulled me to a wall and pushed me against it. Not forcefully, just intentionally.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so it seemed he was into this, backing me into walls, assuming his godlike position at the forefront of my existence, asserting his power over me, watching me bend to his will. I&rsquo;d written about it, I&rsquo;d described it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he want me to resist? I didn&rsquo;t want to resist. I was here for it, all of it. Whatever he wanted, I&rsquo;d go with it. Was that too easy? Did he want more of a fight? I&rsquo;d gotten over the base fear for my life.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; he told me with his voice, affirming it with the hot menace in his eyes. The menace didn&rsquo;t look like it lied. I believed I was beautiful to him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for saying that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think <em>you&rsquo;re</em> beautiful,&rdquo; I returned the compliment. I mean, <em>fuck me now,</em> but that&rsquo;s how I felt about him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to be thinking about my words.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do. I really do.&rdquo; <em>Just look at me, I&rsquo;m drinking in the sight of you, my eyes are singing for you.</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes roved over my body, was he drinking me in too? It looked like he approved.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat, take your shirt off for me.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes lost their voice for a moment, instantly shy.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Take it off. Let me see you.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>so long as he touches me &ndash; if he touches me it&rsquo;ll be okay &ndash; if he&rsquo;ll touch me</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a regular shirt, I&rsquo;d been relaxing in my quarters. I pulled it over my head.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at him. The bra, too? Yes, of course. I took it off, dropped it to the floor.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>i&rsquo;m exposed&hellip;please throw me on the bed&hellip;i&rsquo;m skinned for you&hellip;cover me&hellip;enter me</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could he see the nervous beating of my heart? My shallow, tremulous breathing? Did my face look stricken, uncertain?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he liked it.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, Agat.&rdquo; Still smiling.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took my face in his hand again and held it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;like in Ops but gently, as when he&rsquo;d said goodbye. He kissed me, I kissed him back, any part of me he touched, I would return to him, I would give to him. I would give him <em>myself, </em>as long as he&rsquo;d take me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took me with power in his other hand, he took possession of me between my legs. He gripped firmly like he held title to me, I was his to hold, I belonged wholly, solely, to his strong hand.&nbsp;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I groaned, I pressed into him. Damn, the armor. I&rsquo;d forgotten about it, why was that still on him? I hadn&rsquo;t felt it against my naked breasts before, that was new. I didn&rsquo;t like it. But my preference was inconsequential. His lips and his hand were my world now.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulling off me to speak, a fraction, a millimeter. &ldquo;Do you like this, Agat? Do you?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;oh god yes&hellip;<em>yesssss</em>&hellip;don&rsquo;t stop! <em>I&rsquo;m yours, I&rsquo;m yours&hellip;</em>&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against my lips. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours&hellip;&rdquo; moaning into him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed me, he wove his tongue into my mouth, it was delicious, we tongued each other, when would he invade, invade me completely, take me, take me&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed me, expertly, masterfully, his thumb in the right spot this time, not like on the floor, <em>ohhhhhhhh god don&rsquo;t let me pass out before he can open me and push himself in and devastate me with his treasure</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thumb, his thumb asked me if I liked it, <em>oh fuck yes, fuck yes, more than anything, more than life, oh gggoddddd </em>control me control me <em>I&rsquo;m yours to control and destroy</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing on his wrist, it chirped at him. The communicator. Whatever the hell it is. It needed his attention, it got it, he looked at it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t smile at it. He rolled his eyes.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at me again. Sighing with impatience, shaking his head.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a problem. I&rsquo;m needed back. I have to leave.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>had that been translated correctly?</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed his hands on the wall to either side of me, above my head, looking down at me intently. Not very far down, I&rsquo;m not that much shorter than he is.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised my swirling eyes to his, to his menacing beauty.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat. I&rsquo;ll be back. I don&rsquo;t know when. But I will be. I want you to think about me while I&rsquo;m gone. Will you do that for me?&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>only until you show me how not to</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I will think about you.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I will think of nothing else. You are everything. I want you.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling. &ldquo;Good, Agat. I&rsquo;ll see you.&rdquo;
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning, walking to the door, letting it open, stepping through, striding away.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d never touched my breasts.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d only watched me skin myself. He&rsquo;d only looked. He&rsquo;d only seen.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving me when I&rsquo;m skinned is not a great time to leave me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn&rsquo;t know that. He didn&rsquo;t mean it. He doesn&rsquo;t know me. He doesn&rsquo;t know who he fucked. He doesn&rsquo;t know how I feel, how I fear that someone who sees my breasts won&rsquo;t want me and will leave me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t know it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me like that.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Would he?</em>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rolled my body over against the wall, so that I faced it, and then I slammed the side of my fist into it, hard, a number of times, a great number of times. When I&rsquo;d punished my fist enough I sank to my knees on the floor, tucking my head over them, inhaling my hollow huddled darkness.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My god I wanted him.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>My god, I wanted my god, my dark and glowing god.</em>
     <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
