<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round&nbsp;</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel</em>
    <p></p>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space</em>
    
    <p></p>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!</em>
<br><br /><br />
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I woke up with the sense that the centuries-old song had been winding through my head for quite some time now, circling in a holding pattern until I would come around and fly away with it. I must have been out for a while. I felt cold. I was lying in my uniform without a blanket. Actually without a blanket or a pillow. In fact the floor under me was cold and hard. I lay in the dark and listened to the song for a while. When it ran out I let it start over.
<br><br /><br />
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Like a tunnel you can follow to a tunnel of its own</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone</em>
<br><br /><br />
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guessed I was ready to look at the floor finally and acknowledge that it was the floor of the corridor where I had fallen and blacked out. If the floor was here, then so was the station. So that was probably good.&nbsp;
<br><br /><br />
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream</em>
<br><br /><br />
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It was dark. Weren&rsquo;t the corridors usually lit? What was&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;oh wait, something about life support&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;also what time was it right now?&nbsp;
<br><br /><br />
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?</em>
<br><br /><br />
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Okay, let&rsquo;s sit up. I used a hand to push up from the floor. Shit, my neck was tweaked, I couldn&rsquo;t move that way. Aw <em>fuck</em>, that hurt. Okay, let&rsquo;s roll over. Okay, I could sit up that way. Shit. My face. Let's just touch it lightly and see&hellip; Ouch. <em>Ohhhhh, damn.</em> Shit. I was hurting.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I wanted the doctor. The communicators should have been working&hellip;right? They <em>were</em> working when&nbsp;&mdash;
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuck.&nbsp;</em>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all came back. Oh, God. I couldn&rsquo;t talk to anybody, <em>I couldn't</em>. Never mind the communicators. Let&rsquo;s just fly away&hellip;
<br><br /><br />
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel</em>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As the images unwind, like the circles that you find</em>
<br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the windmills of your mind!</em>
