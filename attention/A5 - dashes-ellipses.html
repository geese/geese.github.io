    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My quiet plans for the evening changed after I'd returned to my quarters and taken a shower. I decided to go out for a while. There were still a few people out and about, and I wanted to be out there too. Not <em>with </em>them, really, just among them. By myself, but not totally alone.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The station hadn't gone <em>completely</em> to pieces. Earlier while walking the Promenade I'd noticed that Quark's was still open. Very quiet and much darker than usual, but open. Julian had filled me in about the life support system and the rest of the station's status in regard to the shit that had happened with the power grid and the main fusion reactor. Repair crews were on it, and it was looking like we'd all at least be alive through the night, with operations gradually returning to normal over the next several days. Likely sometime tomorrow we'd begin coordinating the return of those people who'd evacuated in runabouts today.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also learned that Dukat had transported back to his ship, immediately after I'd run out of Ops. Probably, had he wished to, he would have already been able to leave&nbsp;-&nbsp;oh, say, <em>ten minutes prior</em>. Ass. If that was true, then why did he risk his life just to fuck with me? He had no more guarantee than anyone else, that Sisko and O'Brien would succeed in their last ditch effort to prevent our destruction. Did he have an internal eye on the clock? Had he been prepared to disappear at a moment's notice, just as soon as he figured it was time to get the fuck out, regardless of whether or not he'd&nbsp;-&nbsp;ahem, <em>finished </em>his activities? His motivations were puzzling. But why devote any more thought or energy to this man?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the infirmary I'd remembered my wrists&nbsp;-&nbsp;felt them, actually&nbsp;-&nbsp;I'd been right, I <em>had</em> forgotten to 'itemize' one of my injuries. Julian had been very displeased to see the additional markings. But he hadn't pressed for details. There wasn't much to say about it anyway&nbsp;-&nbsp;they were hand marks and it was clear how they'd gotten there. He finally dismissed me to my quarters with an earnest squeeze to my shoulders and an admonition to "eat something and rest". I felt like I'd escaped from him intact&nbsp;-&nbsp;I hadn't been made to reveal any <em>truer </em>information about what had happened.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to loosen up and let go, forget my worries for a while, maybe kind of feel like a more relaxed version of myself. Maybe I'd go get a drink at Quark's. I had a regular night for that. Tonight wasn't it, but why not just go anyway? I could sure use it. I didn't feel like eating, as Julian had urged, but I knew that drinking on a <em>totally</em> empty stomach would be a bad idea. I made myself eat a slice of toast and some cheese, all I could manage. I dressed in leggings and a soft button-up shirt and didn't bother with makeup. I didn't want to have to wash it off later.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ordered my usual, a whiskey sour, no ice, asking for a double shot tonight. It seemed that Quark shot me a funny sort of look. That was weird. Why the look? Because of the double shot? Or had he heard something? What would he have heard? I figured I'd imagined it. For the second time today I let my feet carry me to an upper level, climbing the stairs to stand alone at the balcony with my drink, feeling comfortably unnoticed in the dimmer than usual darkness. On a normal evening it would have been a nice vantage point for people watching. But there were so few people out now&nbsp;-&nbsp;even fewer than earlier&nbsp;-&nbsp;that it felt more like I was watching for shooting stars.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambience here was also very different tonight, in contrast to the usual chaotic noisescape. It sounded like a quiet private lounge&nbsp;-&nbsp;all it needed was a tasteful musician with a mellow instrument. Sipping my drink, I felt as though I gazed out over clouds of dark tranquility, gentle sounds from below floating up lazily, softly waving, misty tendrils of murmuring voices and quietly clinking glasses.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I surmised that Quark's wait staff and dabo girls had been among those who'd evacuated the station today, otherwise they'd surely be here&nbsp;-&nbsp;no way they'd get the night off even in these fucked up circumstances. Wasn't one of the dabo girls named Daphne? The name called to mind a story I'd read as a child, a myth from ancient Greece, an Earth civilization. Actually, this particular story was attributed to a Roman poet...either way, it concerned the same gods, and it had troubled me at the time I'd read it. The gist of it was that the god Apollo was crazy for Daphne, a river nymph. He wanted to love her so badly that he chased her. She ran from him, ran and ran, but knew she wouldn't escape him and cried to her river god father for help. He turned her into a tree, so that when Apollo caught her, he couldn't&nbsp;-&nbsp;well, he couldn't love her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story troubled me because, being too young to know about sex or rape, I didn't get it. I didn't understand <em>why</em> Daphne would run from Apollo.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing was, if I could have been Daphne, I would have<em> let Apollo catch me</em>. In real life I'd always been treated as fundamentally undesirable. I so wanted to be caught and loved instead. And Apollo was magnificent! He was the god of music and archery and prophecy and sun and light&nbsp;-&nbsp;he pulled the sun across the sky every day with his four-horse chariot! I would <em>never</em> have run away from such a desirable male entity who loved me so much that he wanted to tackle me to the ground with his love. What a tragic waste.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were messed up with my parents when I was a girl. They split. And then I had to pacify the dominant scary one by denying my love for the&nbsp;-&nbsp;well, the loving one. Because the scary one bitterly hated the loving one and would punish me for loving him, when my duty was to hate him. I kept myself safe from harm by showing feelings that weren't true, and hiding ones that were. 'Safe from harm' but starved for love.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why if the god Apollo had chased me because he wanted to <em>force love on me</em> regardless of what I either showed him or hid from him, I would have let him fucking catch me. If he wanted to force love on me <em>even if I was afraid and tried to fight him off,</em> I would have let him fucking catch me. If he wanted to force love on me because there was no chance he'd change his mind once he could actually see me&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>oh Daphne, why didn't you just let him fucking catch you?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting my glass on the cocktail table next to me, I noticed a person standing by it, an arm resting on it. An arm wearing that same intriguing chevron-like pattern on its sleeve that I'd seen before. This was no Apollo. <em>Or was he? </em>I'd grown up and eventually worked out that, desirable as he was, Apollo wasn't such a nice guy. His 'love' for Daphne was so selfish that when he couldn't take her, he <em>claimed</em> her instead&nbsp;-&nbsp;as <em>his</em> tree&nbsp;-&nbsp;twisting from her boughs a wreath which would forever serve as a symbol of <em>him</em>, the mighty god.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agat. I was hoping to catch you tonight."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up at the face from which these words had been dispatched to penetrate my quietude. <em>Those eyes. </em>They startled me inwardly, electrically, as if a many-headed snake lying coiled in my depths had suddenly snapped to attention, its tangled necks writhing in anticipation. He hadn't left a scalpel blade inside me. <em>He'd left his eyes.</em> And looking at them I could see that he hadn't returned to take them out, or to take them back.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How...?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled. "Oh, I dropped by earlier and asked about you. Quark told me you're something of a regular. I offered him a very nice reward to contact me if he happened to see you."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I <em>hadn't </em>imagined the funny look from Quark. He'd sold me out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, you like, orbited the station or something? Waiting for word from Quark? Or did you leave and come back?" I shook my head. "You know what&nbsp;-&nbsp;never mind, don't even tell me, I don't want to know."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed. "I wanted to see you again. I thought you were fun."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fun.&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How nice for him that he had a word for it. I hadn't been able to find one yet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking the whiskey might give me a little courage, I threw down another couple of gulps. I looked him directly in the eyes, straight at him. I wanted to <em>own myself</em>, and looking in his eyes now, now that he wasn't hurting me, felt like how to do it. He didn't own me before, he didn't own me now, and he would <em>never</em> own me. Just as Apollo would never own Daphne.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a sinking unrest in my gut foretold that he would <em>hold</em> me. He'd left those eyes in me and I felt their power. They knew me. They were <em>joined</em> to me, to my most inner self, by the imprinted memory of his hand. Not the one that had brought pain. The other. It didn't need to be touching me to hold me in its grip now. My body automatically responded to its nearness like a harnessed slave. The hand rested casually on the table before me. I tried not to look at it. I remembered it well. Large, strong, demanding. Even now I could feel it already working its possessive hold on me again, dragging me with it to my earlier state from which there'd been no turning back, when I'd been ready, so<em> powerlessly ready</em> for him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept looking into his eyes, those eyes that had reached so terribly deep inside me and <em>seen</em>, seen me. I knew&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>and he fucking knew</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;he wouldn't own me, but what he'd done to me had make me sick with a desire to be <em>claimed</em>. I was Daphne and I didn't want to run from his crazy 'love'. How could I run when he'd made me want to <em>fall</em>, to give myself to his hands? I wanted them now, how could I not? I wanted his hands to claim my face, my neck, my throat, my breasts, my thighs&nbsp;-&nbsp;I wanted him to <em>kiss </em>my thighs&nbsp;-&nbsp;push them apart and claim them with his lips&nbsp;-&nbsp;would he?&nbsp;-&nbsp;what would that be like&nbsp;-&nbsp;would he <em>lick</em> me? Would he trail his tongue along my thighs as he had done my jaw? I remembered it, the thick hot wetness of it&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>ohhhh it had ended me</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;I wanted to see him look up at me with <em>those commanding eyes</em> and open his mouth and heat me, wet me, <em>taste me</em> where he had taken me in his hand today&nbsp;-&nbsp;then lower his face and nuzzle, nuzzle me with his little ridge, stroke me, part me with the muscle of his tongue, suck me into his mouth, hold me, keep me, claim me...&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>How could I possibly say I didn't want this?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't need to catch me&nbsp;-&nbsp;I was fucking caught. And I wanted it. And <em>that </em>was what made it fun for him. The power. The conquest. But it wasn't something I wanted to just <em>give</em> to him. I didn't want to be <em>fun</em> for him&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>for him&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>maybe I wanted him, but I didn't exist for him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you drinking, Agat?"&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This? It's called a 'whiskey sour'. Whiskey is the liquor. The syrup is both sweet and sour." <em>Why the fuck was I telling him this?</em> "Would you like to try it?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very much. I would love to know what you like to taste."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Did he really need to say that? </em>I felt lightheaded as my tongue heard him loud and clear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew in a slow sip, looking at me thoughtfully as he swallowed it. "Agat." He sipped again. "This feels like your name."&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to explain. "Your name is a word in my language, it's&nbsp;-&nbsp;it's one of the <em>feels</em> that a particular flavor can have in the mouth. Some flavors <em>bite</em>, other ones <em>coat and stick..</em>." Tipping the glass in his hand, he absently gazed at the liquid while his lips and tongue explored the sensation lingering inside his mouth. "Your drink&nbsp;-&nbsp;its feel is <em>'agat'</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;you hear it isn't translated&nbsp;-&nbsp;it just feels like what it does."&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Agat...</em>" He looked at me. "I like it in my mouth."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Ohhhhh, I did too... just kill me now...</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered how he'd held my face oddly today, saying my name like it made him feel good.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is your name common among humans? I've not heard it before."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. I think it <em>may </em>be, in particular regions of Earth, but it's always been unusual wherever I've gone. I've never met anyone who's heard it before, aside from my mother&nbsp;-&nbsp;she named me for Agatha of Sicily." I shrugged. "Who, of course, you wouldn't have any reason to know about. I don't know if many humans would anymore, either."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who was she?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was a woman, a young woman. She lived...about twenty-five hundred years ago, during the rule of the Roman Empire. She had taken a vow of virginity. A Roman prefect wanted to have her and tried to change her mind."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised an eyebrow at the word 'prefect'. <em>I'd walked right into that... </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And did he?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. She resisted him."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes took on a predatory gleam.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That sounds unwise."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She didn't think so."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't want to tell him the rest of the story, which involved gruesome torture&nbsp;-&nbsp;not with him eyeing me the way he was beginning to now, like he had just learned of...<em>of a rebellion among his workers.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me your hands."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me. Your hands."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held them out to him. He took them in his. The hold seared me with the thrill of first surrender&nbsp;-&nbsp;the first of myself that I'd yielded to him, that he hadn't taken by force. He slid his hands up, just past my wrists, halting on my forearms. He stepped closer to me, very close.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would she choose to resist him, Agat?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...maybe...maybe he came on too strong," I spoke softly to the ridge under his nose.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped again, this time moving me with him, forcing me back until he had me trapped against one of the station's wall struts. "I don't think so." He tightened his hold on my arms, pushing them down, pressing himself into my body so that I was entirely riveted in place. "I think, <em>maybe he didn't come on strong enough</em>."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up from his ridge, up to his eyes. Their intensity could skin something alive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Resist me, Agat."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came to me what he was doing. He was reenacting our conflict from earlier today, when he'd backed me into a wall, threatened me, proved his power to hurt me, restrained me by my arms, removed all my options save one, <em>exposed his neck to me... </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he was <em>baiting me </em>with his neck<em>.</em> He wanted me to try it&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>just try it&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>to strike out at him to defend myself. His eyes told me he would devastate me as soon as I made my move. I was his fucking prey. He was toying with me before he&nbsp;-&nbsp;before he <em>what</em> exactly?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Young Agatha, she hadn't escaped with her body or her life...how did it happen...was it anything like this...&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched me. Waiting. Motionless. Daring me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Do it.&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Bite it, Agat. Bite it fucking hard.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What choice did I have?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many-headed snake gnawed at my gut as I absorbed the hard reality of my bind and readied myself for what was to follow. I began lowering my face to the large ridge on the side of his neck&nbsp;-&nbsp;slowly&nbsp;-&nbsp;a most hesitant sort of march to the scaffold. No sign of injury from my previous bite&nbsp;-&nbsp;if there'd been any it was gone now.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt him stiffen at the touch of my breath, steeling himself for the attack.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Why would he invite this?</em> He'd wrenched me off by the hair when I'd done it before&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em> why did he want it now</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>why</em>? Was it like a drug for him? A shot of searing agony exploding into a natural high&nbsp;-&nbsp;enhancing the boner he'd get from overpowering his captive female&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>his boner, his high, his...his</em>...&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, <em>fuck</em> this!&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should he get all the pleasure and I get all the damage? If he was taking me down again, I wanted some too, couldn't I get some for myself?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would I get?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W<em>hat, Agat&nbsp;-&nbsp;what would you get&nbsp;-&nbsp;what would you want&nbsp;-&nbsp;what, what&nbsp;-&nbsp;?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My raw desire answered before I could, and went for it&nbsp;-&nbsp;my nose nuzzling its way onto his ridge, the first contact undamming a deluge of craving I hadn't realized&nbsp;-&nbsp;I opened my mouth and laid my tongue down. O<em>hhhhh it felt so good to me,</em> his bumpy ridge felt so right and inevitable<em>,</em> this was <em>my fucking ridge</em> now, <em>mine</em>. I moved the whole of my tongue against it and licked him hard and hungry&nbsp;-&nbsp;but not the whole length, I didn't have time for that because I had to <em>get him in my mouth</em> before he ripped me away&nbsp;-&nbsp;the rigid feel of him on my tongue compelled me to close my lips on him and suck hard, and then lick again greedily, selfishly, move up a bump and <em>suck</em> and pull at him and suck more, and now I was off the ridge and falling over his neck, tasting his bed of scales, drawing my ravenous tongue across his throat under his chin, licking him, tonguing him, this was for Agat, <em>for Agat&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>at any moment he'd seize me by my hair and it would be over. I feasted on his texture like it was the very last morsel of anything good I would ever know again and I needed to get it, take it, take it from him when he tore me off, at any moment, <em>at any moment</em>...&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course he didn't tear me off. I can look back on it now and see that I unknowingly pulled off the mother of all surprise assaults, soundly knocking him off his game with the first blow of hot wet pleasure on the sensitive spot where he'd braced for excruciation. I had missed the obvious, I hadn't seen that I had any tactical advantage&nbsp;-&nbsp;but then, I'd also not been trained to think strategically while pinned to a wall by someone I was terrified of and horny for at the same time. I didn't grasp what was going on right away&nbsp;-&nbsp;that he had almost instantaneously gone out of his mind and was feverishly granting my tongue free rein over his throat, over his neck, over his ridges, over all of his surface that was exposed above his armor and under his face, over all of it that I could physically reach with my mouth.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I focused mindlessly on stealing his texture before <em>my</em> world went black with pain, all of my senses concentrated on what was under my tongue. I wasn't conscious of him pressing his throat against me and groaning until I began to<em> feel</em> his noises in my mouth. I closed my eyes to savor them&nbsp;-&nbsp;I could see the vibrations shimmering like rippling starlight in the darkness. It felt restorative to wrap myself around the sensation and hold it, feel it, fall into it&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>eyes closed&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>ohhhhh, he hadn't allowed me to do that today, he hadn't let me wrap myself around the warm undulating waves he had released into my body, he hadn't let me drift over them and fall into them. He'd made me hold my eyes open so I couldn't float, I couldn't sink&nbsp;-&nbsp;but now, <em>now</em> I could, now I could draw my tongue so slowly and heavily across his scales and plunge myself into his gently rocking roughness, roll around in it, lie down over it. The more I enjoyed him and floated on him and sunk into him the more he groaned and I started to hear it, I heard him breathing heavily, unevenly. I heard him muttering words in soft gasps&nbsp;-&nbsp;they weren't translated, I guessed whatever he was saying was too dirty to translate.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized I could unleash my <em>own</em> sounds now, he wouldn't stop me this time. I was free to moan with the pleasure of feeling him all over my mouth, to whimper in my impatience&nbsp;-&nbsp;desperate because where I licked I wasn't sucking and where I sucked I wasn't licking&nbsp;-&nbsp;I always wanted more of the one while missing the other. While licking and tasting his coarseness I would whimper until finding a ridge segment to suck on&nbsp;-&nbsp;then I'd moan with relief at finding the treasure, finding and closing my lips on it and pulling it into my mouth.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now overtaken, wild with the freedom to abandon myself to sound, to movement, to blind sensation&nbsp;-&nbsp;I began to feel something else&nbsp;-&nbsp;gratitude, so grateful to be free now, free this time&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>more</em> free anyhow. I began to kiss him wherever I found my mouth. I was on his throat and began kissing it and I heard him say <em>"no"</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;had I imagined it? He said it again, <em>"no"</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;but his body didn't seem to agree, he still eagerly served his open neck to me. I didn't understand.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paused. "Should I stop?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moaned his answer, "<em>NO&nbsp;-&nbsp;don't stop, don't stop."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kissed him more, and again I heard him saying <em>"no" </em>but he was still pressing into me, what did he want?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paused again with my lips on his throat.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, tell me what you want."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"...your tongue," </em>he gasped. <em>"Lick me...lick me..."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I teased him with another kiss. His moan was fucking delicious.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"No...lick me..."&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another kiss, slow, soft, lingering.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Ohhhhh Agat...please...please..."&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fucker didn't deserve to be allowed to beg for anything after what he did to me today, when he had watched me beg him without begging, begging for what he was making me want so bad, what he could <em>see in my eyes</em> that I wanted so bad. He didn't deserve either my permission to beg or my mercy, but I was overcome with lust for the feeling of power it gave me, just this <em>small simple power</em>, to hear him beg for what only I could give him at this moment. It turned me on so much I couldn't stop myself from licking him again, just as he wanted, so I gave it to him and took his violent groans all over my tongue, took them for myself.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to make him beg again so I tongued my way over to his ridge, to <em>my fucking ridge</em> that I had claimed&nbsp;-&nbsp;I licked and sucked it all along its length now, starting at his shoulder and moving up voraciously. When I had reached as high as I could, almost to his ear, I began kissing it. I knew what he wanted. I wanted to hear him say it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He writhed. <em>"Ohhhhhh Agat...no...no...please..."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fucking way. Say it. Say it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"...please...pleeeease, Agat...," </em>moaning so hard against me, straining.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More kisses, warm, softly pulling kisses.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between kisses, "Tell me what you want. Tell me..."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"...Agat..."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"...suck it, suck it...pleeease...please suck on it..."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...that's it....say it again."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Ohhhhh Agat...!"</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say. It."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Suck me! Suck me! Ahhhhh, Agat! Please!!"</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to swallow his groans again so I gave him what he asked for, and now his hold on me turned to iron. I don't think he knew where he was anymore. He started grinding himself into my body, below his armor, shoving his unambiguous <em>need </em>against me so madly, so roughly, no way I'd miss it even with that fucking armor crushing a new series of bruises into my torso. I wouldn't go to Julian for those.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was starting to hurt, but I also found that sucking on his ridge paired perfectly with the pain. If he'd had any rational mind left, maybe he'd have released my arms so I could help him out&nbsp;-&nbsp;I would have immediately ripped into his pants and taken him and jerked him off, just to feel him, just to feel what he was pushing into me, just to feel him in my hand...&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>What the fuck was I thinking, that's not what I would have done!</em> No, if I'd gotten that far I would have dropped to my knees and had him all the way in my mouth so he could take me right there&nbsp;-&nbsp;ohhhhh I had to close my eyes and let that fantasy surge over me and into me while I sucked him and he thrust himself against me. To be honest I thought it <em>might</em> have felt too demeaning to let him do that to me for real, the way I wanted it right now, the way I wanted him to look down on me and grip me by my hair and <em>have</em> me, have me <em>hard, </em>have me <em>mean. </em>I wanted that but I also didn't want it&nbsp;-&nbsp;I wanted some of it but not all of it&nbsp;-&nbsp;okay most of it but not all of it. I wanted him to take me and overtake me and end me but not...not diminish me, not reduce me to nothing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him asking me to suck on him more, more&nbsp;-&nbsp;but this time I wasn't the only one to hear it. It had only just occurred to me that we might possibly have been disturbing the dark tranquility of the quiet downstairs 'lounge' with...oh, these would have been some, well, some <em>explicit </em>sounds floating down from the balcony...heavy breathing and gasps, whimpers, groans, maybe some muffled thumping, maybe some <em>wet</em> sorts of noises, certainly a man loudly moaning what sounded like "suck me&nbsp;-&nbsp;suck me&nbsp;-&nbsp;ahhhhh, 'oh God' please!"&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, it wasn't like it was the most family-friendly sort of place anyway. But even Quark had his limits. He roared up at us from below.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"DUKAT!" </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had <em>never</em> heard that tone from Quark before.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"GET. A. FUCKING. ROOM!!"</em>
