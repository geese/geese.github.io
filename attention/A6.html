    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first time I&rsquo;d witnessed the orange shimmer of a Cardassian transporter beam from the inside. I rematerialized somewhere on Dukat&rsquo;s ship, very disoriented by the sudden and total reconfiguration of my surroundings&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the nearest of which was his embrace. He grabbed my hand and pulled me after him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;getting us that room&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;leading me through unfamiliar dark corridors, past curious Cardassian men, through a door, into his quarters. I mean, it had to be his quarters. Rather spartan in its furnishings. Dimly lit. The warmth was nice&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m thin and get cold easily. Wait, why would I even think about that? Well&hellip;because <em>of course</em>. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost kind of laughed at my situation, which really wasn&rsquo;t very funny at all. Apollo had tackled me <em>and</em> made off with me to his chariot in the heavens. <em>Seriously?</em> 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I&rsquo;d felt alone with him before, this was a whole new level of it. I hadn&rsquo;t worn my combadge. <em>No one</em> knew where I was. There was no river god father to help me here. I didn&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d get back. I didn&rsquo;t know <em>if </em> I&rsquo;d get back, or when. All I knew for certain was <em>why</em> I was here. Where was there to run now? 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I perceived that I had exactly one choice. I could fight him and&hellip;die&hellip;or something. <em>What would happen if I fought him?</em> Or&hellip;I could run <em>into</em> the danger and maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t <em>kill</em> me to die&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;or something. I damn well knew the danger had become my fucking desire. Was this really a choice?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boots were off. I looked at his armor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That has to come off too.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No argument there. He removed everything hard and bulky, placing it all on a bench of sorts, out of the way. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he faced me again, his appearance in the remaining dark fabric took my breath away. I&rsquo;d always liked the look of a man in black. This was no exception. He was handsome. <em>How had I not seen it?</em> And without the armor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was <em>sleek</em>. His lines were transformed. His body looked like the depthless velvet night following in his wake as he pulled the sun across the sky. Just as on the balcony, my raw desire knew what I wanted before I did. My desire recalled that my hands were free now&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;free to be on him, to <em>move </em>over him, to explore him, to feel him. I found myself running my hands over the places where his neck had met his armor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;here there was no rude interruption of his surface, no incursion of indigestible shell onto delectable fruit&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it was spellbinding. I stroked my palms over his collarbones because I could, because they lay under my hands, because they were <em>him, </em>because they were quiet. I brought my lips to them and kissed them.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing this part of him brought about a strange moment for me, a twisting pang of futile longing. Something about the accessibility of his simply and darkly clothed body, something about the unarmored nearness of him and the quietness of the new terrain under my lips&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;something about the warmth around us&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;somehow it felt like rest. I wanted to fold and <em>rest </em>on him, against the darkness of his chest, just stop, just rest. Just hold. I wished I could. This was like times when I&rsquo;d been exhausted but didn&rsquo;t know it until I sat down. Kissing his collarbones was like suddenly sitting down, like my heart&rsquo;s knees had buckled under. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been a wretched day. My friend had died. The rest of us had nearly died. This&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this man under my lips had set the core of me on fire and leveled me to the ground, only returning to see to it that I was still in flames, still in collapse. If he would just hold me now, we could stop. I would lie on him, on the darkness of him. I would sink into the warm night. I wished I could. Just for this moment, I wished I could. I moved my arms around him like I could have him this way, like he would hold me this way.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew he hadn&rsquo;t brought me here to comfort me. Here I was even more alone than alone.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His response to my arms around him didn&rsquo;t compute at first&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his hands went to my ribs and firmly pushed me away. As I stood muddledly absorbing the withdrawal of his hold, he finished undressing his upper body and then it made sense&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was just moving us along. He reached to take me in against himself again.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, wait&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put my hands up, on his chest just under the collarbones, pausing him at my bent arm&rsquo;s length. I had to see. I had to drink in what he had just unveiled to me. <em>Who the hell was responsible for dispensing beauty in this universe? </em>This was unfair. His form was taut with his strength, pleasingly shaped by it, by his lean strength, his tightly coiled physical power. Arms, shoulders, chest, abdominals&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his body held all the primal, potent <em>male</em> allure that I thirsted to be looking up at&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;from underneath, from heady submission, from on my back. His texture was liberally enhanced in places&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;ridged&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;ornamented&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;so sweetly frosted with scales&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;down his shoulders, over his pecs, under his ribs, tracing his waist.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking beautiful,&rdquo; </em>I breathed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body had me in flames, in collapse, <em>in ruin</em>. I wanted&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>I needed</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to be naked on him. I needed to be naked on him everywhere possible. My fingers went to my shirt, unbuttoning it, opening it, exposing my breasts to him. They&rsquo;re small, I hadn&rsquo;t worn a bra tonight, I hadn&rsquo;t needed to. Up until just now I&rsquo;d forgotten that he had yet to peel away <em>all </em>my defenses, that I could feel <em>any more fucking vulnerable</em> before him, that he hadn&rsquo;t yet seen, <em>hadn&rsquo;t seen me</em>, even after all that he&rsquo;d already torn open. I felt self-conscious about my breasts. They&rsquo;re beautiful, I know they are, but&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s the <em>&lsquo;but&rsquo;</em> that&rsquo;s always eaten at me, shamed me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>but they&rsquo;re small</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;deep down I feared they could never be enough&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;anyone who discovered them would discard me, wouldn&rsquo;t want me. I felt this way when I opened my shirt to him, when I saw <em>his </em>eyes discover me, utterly defenseless at last. As ever, I was afraid to read them&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;reading them might destroy me even more.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But why should it fucking matter?</em> He didn&rsquo;t deserve an opinion! He had <em>brutalized</em> me today. He should have treasured me. <em>Fuck him.</em> I was so angry. He was such a destroyer. But then, it was my anger that had made me want to fuck him in the first place.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Damn this man, this fucking beautiful man.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed to come in for the attack, get away from his eyes, take him down, take him with the only effective means I&rsquo;d learned so far in our brief history&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;get back on his throat and ravish it again. This time l led the charge with my breasts so he could fucking feel them&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I threw my arms around his neck, pulling my body into his, pressing, rubbing my nipples on him, aggressively, roughly&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>feel them, fucker, feel them&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they want you, feel them&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>if anything, my unobtrusive breasts served excellently to usher so much more of my sensitized skin into contact with his, they allowed me to <em>have</em> so much of him, to <em>devour</em> so much of him with so much of <em>me</em>. Just as before, I was tormented by a stinging anticipation that he would rip me off him <em>at any moment&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>only this time it was my breasts rather than my tongue, that fought to steal his texture before he could throw me away from him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he <em>was</em> pushing me away&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his hands were on my ribs again, pushing me.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em>&hellip;Agat&hellip;<em>&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t help it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I tried to read his eyes. I saw menace, stabbing menace.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But his eyes always looked like that, didn&rsquo;t they?&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t pushing me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was pulling&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;holding my waist, not my ribs&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;pulling me down.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;Agat&hellip;come here&hellip;come here&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pulling me down, onto him, onto a chair, onto his lap, so that I straddled him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>ohhhhhhhh my god&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I could feel him, I could feel him</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time no staggered delay in comprehending what the hell I wanted&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;my desire, my hips, my mind, my <em>need</em>, every aspect of myself all together <em>fucking knew </em>what to do with what was underneath me, between my legs, in his pants, under my leggings&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>ohhhhhhhh god he was hard, he was so hard</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;probably those curious Cardassian men out there heard my crying groans&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>oh fuuuuuuuccckkk&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>I was pressing, rubbing, grinding on him, grinding myself dizzy, didn&rsquo;t take me long to come on him all over again, <em>ohhhhhhhh </em>this man&rsquo;s body could make me come so hard, so good, <em>oh my god</em> and I could hold him, I could hold his face against me, hold his head, I could weave my hands into his hair and hold him to myself, and hold him, and hold him, and hold him, and ride the waves and crash and go under and come up again and<em> come on him, come over him, come in his lap, oh my goddddddddddddd</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was just the first of it. This didn&rsquo;t end me, <em>oh hell no, </em>this didn&rsquo;t end anything.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hands were in his hair. I pulled his head back to see him, to see his eyes again. I saw that same intensity, the intensity that could skin something alive. I wanted him to skin <em>me</em> alive and he did, he slid my shirt off my shoulders. I let go of him so he could slide the shirt all the rest of the way down my arms and off of me. He skinned me and then while looking into my eyes he claimed my breasts with his hands and I gasped&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in his eyes I could see it, I could read it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he wanted me, <em>he fucking wanted me.&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked down in wonder at my breasts being enfolded and ardently fondled in his big gray Cardassian hands. They looked like rugged artist&rsquo;s hands&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the coarsely deliberate hands of a fevered artist burning with inspiration&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;fervently yet painstakingly sculpting a pair of achingly delicate living figurines out of great big chunks of rough unpolished marble. <em>How could this man be the one to chisel me and show me my beauty? </em>He eyed the marred skin where his armor had crushed against me earlier, moving his thumbs from my breasts just far enough to lightly caress the marks. He pressed his lips to me there, deeply, his first kiss on my body, his only kiss on me anywhere so far. I shuddered, weaving my hands into his hair again, my thumbs caressing his brow ridges, I kissed them, I kissed all the ridges on his head and his face that were near enough&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d never been so glad for small breasts before&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;with his face on them it only meant I could feel him so close to me, I could reach more of him with my lips, my face.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to <em>see more</em>, see more of him handling my breasts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it aroused me to be so totally vulnerable to him, so small, so soft, so breached, so commanded, so mastered by this man, this rough, bullying, infuriating man, this <em>fucking brute.</em> I wanted to watch him have me. I wanted to see him take me. He had my breasts. I wanted to see. I watched him rub his cheek, rub <em>his ridge</em> on my nipple, the little ridge under his nose, above his lip. <em>Ohhhhhh god take it, fucking take it.</em> I gripped his hair, panting shakily, fingering his scalp. I watched him extend his tongue and press it against me under my nipple. I held his hair, gasping, moaning as he licked heavily, over and over, licked the underside of my breast, sliding his open mouth over me and sucking me in, sucking warmly, sucking fully, then <em>so fucking hard</em>. His breath was hot on my skin, his ridges bumpy, they almost scratched me, I wished they did, I would have bled for him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I moved one of my hands to hold his jaw and trace my thumb along the ridge leading to his ear. I could feel the working of it as he persistently took and released his sucking hold only to lick me again, then retake a mouthful and pull and tug. I watched his lips, his tongue on my nipple, I looked at the joining of our two textures together. I was soft, I was smooth&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was rough, he was harsh&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was pink, I was demure&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was stone, he was crude. Together we were wet, hot, steaming. As he demolished one breast with his mouth he crushed the other with his hand, no longer the sensitive sculptor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t care if he smashed me with his hands, with his mouth&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was out of my mind, I wanted him all, I wanted him <em>hard</em>, I wanted him painful, I wanted him devastating.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hips were moving, they were working him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was kneading myself with him, grinding myself insatiably on his stone hardness under me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but now I wanted it, I wanted it out, I had to have it and hold it. I backed off a little so I could press a palm to it and stroke it and feel its size and shape and swell. It wanted out, he groaned and strained, pushing against my hand in return, breathing so hard, he was so beautiful when he heaved and gasped in his mindless need. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to kiss him soon enough, it was going to take too long, much too long to remit him to my care and keeping. I pulled at the waist of his pants, only signaling what I wanted&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it would be quicker if he took them off himself, they were his after all. While he opened them and removed everything I got up just enough to peel my leggings off too, get it all off.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;there he was&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;there he was&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>again who the hell distributed all the fucking treasure in this universe? </em>I felt weak at the sight of him, the sight of his cock, it was large, it was enhanced and ornamented just like the rest of him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more so near the base of it, leaving slick smooth full ripeness extending to the tip of it. I sunk to my knees between his legs and fell on him. I took him in my hand and pressed him to my waiting tongue, as much length as I could lay against my tongue all at once, and I licked him like it would save me, like I was plummeting off a cliff and only my tonguehold could save me from falling back, falling away&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught me by my hair&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;only catching, not ripping&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he pulled me up a little, bringing me up enough to reach his face as he bent down to me. He held my hair with one hand and stroked it with the other, I stroked his wet length with mine&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and he kissed me again, tenderly, on the peak of both my cheekbones&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Agat,&rdquo; </em>his second kiss&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Agat,&rdquo;</em> his third&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I never knew when this man would release these sudden, these scarce drops of sweetness, he <em>slayed </em>me whenever he did. I returned to his treasure, to kiss it, he was so sweet to me sometimes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more like never, <em>but sometimes</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I just wanted to kiss sweetness back onto him from my lips, from my lips onto this sweetest part of him, this delicious part of him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it was <em>fucking </em>delicious. I started licking again, all over, bottom to top, under, over, sides, everywhere. I slid my mouth over the top and took him, plunged over him, all the way down, taking him, taking him all, all the way in to me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;NO.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled me off him by my hair.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I panted in disbelief. <em>What?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up to his eyes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t read what was in them. Menace, sure, but also<em>&hellip;a gleam&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You like to lick me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stared at his eyes, breathing, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then lick me, Agat.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I licked. I watched his eyes and savored him on my tongue. This was not a problem.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kissed him again, <em>ohhhhhhh</em> my lips could bless him forever, I rubbed them on his throbbing goodness, all up and down, I held it to my face and nuzzled my cheek on it, it felt so good to me, it was nice to me, <em>thank you for being so nice to me, so good to me</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I licked and kissed and then I wanted him in my mouth again&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this time testing first, what would he allow? I ran my tongue around the tip and softly drew it between my lips, just the warm tip&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, Agat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gripped my hair tightly and pulled me off again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lick me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>you don&rsquo;t understand&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;you can&rsquo;t hurt me this way&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I want it all&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I want the pain, the relief&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I want the damage, the repair&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but he did understand. That was the gleam in his eyes. He was&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>no, we were</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;playing. Punishing me, slaying me, so roughly, so sweetly. <em>This beautiful man&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I knew. Ohhhhh, now I was going to get it, get it Agat&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up at him. Kissed him. Kissed him on the base.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lips on him, wet, soft, reverent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me. Tell me what you want.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Lick me.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licking&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;yessss&hellip;lick me, Agat.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing, licking&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Agat. Lick me more.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licking, moaning, drowning him on my tongue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this good? Is this what you want?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasping,<em> &ldquo;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;YESSS&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s good Agat&hellip;keep licking&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking him in to me, sucking him, <em>oh god&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled hard, pulled me off.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;NO, AGAT. Lick.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I took him in me again, I had to have him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped, he yanked with even more force.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I panted over his cock and licked it and whimpered, and stroked it with my hand, and kissed it, kissed the tip, licked the tip, kissed it, <em>and then took him in me again&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yanked, he wrenched, he held my hair so tightly now, both hands grasping, he was breathing so hard and shaking, clenching his teeth&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Agat&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Agat&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;lick&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slid him all the way in, I held him in my mouth, I loved him with my tongue, all over, all around, I sucked him&hellip;he was so sweet, so beautiful&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore me off of him, violently, roaring his groan over me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d provoked him too far&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he moved me off, he was bending forward, over me, rising&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he leaned over and seized me at my ribs&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his grip felt angry&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>ohhh </em>- he was pushing me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;almost lifting me but I&rsquo;m a little tall for that&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was pushing me back, pushing me down, lowering me, I was on my back, I was across the bed, naked, spread, looking up at him. He was moving in for the kill, with deadly purpose, he was going to shove it in me, shove it in me hard, brutal&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was going to<em> kill me now&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;kill me hard&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not yet. Not yet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knelt, between my legs, he looked in my eyes, he felt with his hand, <em>ahhhhhhh his hand</em>, this time his hand was wet with me. He felt for his point of entry, his invitation, he teased it with a finger, he rubbed his big rough hand on me. I writhed, I cried, I was going to pass out from aching for him, for his cock.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held it at my entrance, he teased me with the tip of it, he pushed it in just a fraction and then slid it out, pushed it in again, <em>just the cruellest fraction</em> and then slid it out again, touching, teasing, nudging&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried bucking my hips, I tried reaching him, getting him, taking him, <em>he was right there, he was so full and hard and slick</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but nothing would ever happen unless he let it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>fuck he was so beautiful&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Shhhhh,&rdquo;</em> he soothed, and now he lay his cock over the top of my mound, drawing the ripe wet length of it along the groove between my lips&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;slowly, steadily, heavily&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I watched it, I watched it on me, I drank in the sight of our textures together, panting, trying to count how many ways I wanted this man inside me right now, <em>oh god</em>, but I was too out of it, wasn&rsquo;t getting enough oxygen to calculate that sum.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stroked me with himself&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;right there along the top, right where I was most sensitive&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;back, forth, back, forth&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;firmly, measuredly&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he soothed&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I closed my eyes and breathed deeply to the slow heavy rhythm of it. I floated&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he brought me close to coming again but held me not quite there&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;just floating, just bobbing, just rocking on the waves&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>ohhh&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;ohhhhhh&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he knew how to kill me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;how did he know how to kill me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;that&rsquo;s it, Agat&hellip;that&rsquo;s good&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt his warm thick treasure stroking me, stroking me, and then I felt him giving even more to me, he slid his large fingers into me, he slid them evenly, fluidly, in and out of me, all the while heavily stroking me above them, steadily, steadily&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat. Open your eyes. Look at me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened my dizzied eyes and let them refocus, letting them find his eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Was it truly menace if it was always there, always in his eyes, if that was just&hellip;how they were?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled his fingers out of me and raised them to his lip, his bottom lip.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Agat&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at me. Lowering his lip with his fingers, sucking them into his mouth. Licking my wetness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;&hellip;I like it in my mouth.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know how many more ways I could die. It was so hard to count. He was undoing me. Actually he was <em>doing </em>me. Again. But good this time. I might have already been dead, I didn&rsquo;t know anymore.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did want me in his mouth, he wanted to taste, his head was between my thighs. I saw, I felt him kiss them both, one kiss each&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>his fourth, his fifth</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;then he nuzzled his face in me and I looked and I saw and I felt&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his ridge, his little ridge, <em>his beautiful little fucking ridge&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>he teased me with it, <em>right there, right there&hellip;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave me one sweet lingering kiss in the center<em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;six&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>I stopped counting here, no brain left, I was done, I was over&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at me, he issued a command.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat. Hold your breasts for me. Squeeze them for me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>where were my hands?&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;ohhh, in his hair, in his soft hair</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took my breasts, I squeezed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Harder, Agat. Show me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Oh my god</em>. I worshiped them, I reverenced them, I did what his hands had done to them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good. Keep doing it. Hard. <em>Hard, Agat!</em> Good.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He supervised for a few seconds.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Now watch me, Agat&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh god his tongue, his whole tongue, I saw, <em>he claimed me with it, </em>I felt it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t watch anymore, I threw my head back against the bed moaning helplessly and writhing and closing my eyes and I saw it all in the darkness on my lids. It only hurt a little&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was rough&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no he wasn&rsquo;t rough&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;just purposeful, effective&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he sucked or did he nibble, I couldn&rsquo;t tell, whatever it was it was sweet it was swift it was sharp&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and then the warm wet sliding <em>filling </em>of me, the wet muscle, the softly pliable probing, the warm wet expansion, the working of his lips, his mouth, his jaw&hellip; <em>ahhhhh he was bringing me there, all the way, all the way, bringing me&hellip;ahhhhh&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t remember being angry at this man. I mean I had the knowledge of the fact, but not the memory of the emotion. How would it even be possible to be angry with him? How would it be possible to be angry at someone loving me with his mouth, where I was most vulnerable, most sensitive, most <em>myself</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;someone caring for me with his lips, his little ridge&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;someone tending to me with his tongue, his tender tongue inside me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;kissing me, breathing love to me inside me?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still I had knowledge of the fact, and it reminded me of another I&rsquo;d forgotten, about Apollo&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he had angered someone too. I remembered&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the god Eros had been angry with him. Because Apollo had been running his mouth, boasting, being an arrogant asshole, mocking Eros and cracking mean jokes about his archery prowess or lack thereof&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Apollo being the true and powerful archer, Eros being just a <em>&lsquo;girly&rsquo;</em> archer, with his love arrows. Eros finally got fed up with the abuse and shot Apollo so that he&rsquo;d fall in love with Daphne&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>that </em>was why he&rsquo;d chased her, <em>that</em> was why he&rsquo;d been fucking crazy. And that hadn&rsquo;t been enough for Eros, he was <em>quite</em> fucking angry&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he shot Daphne too, he shot her with a hate arrow&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that&rsquo;s why she was running from Apollo. She could only hate him, she would rather die&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;or something&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;than be caught by him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat&hellip;Agat&hellip;open your eyes, Agat&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw his eyes first, when I opened mine. He had come back to me, this sweet fucking beautiful man. He was above me, his body positioned over me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I saw, I felt, he was <em>a primed mass of threat, </em>here to take me at last, to kill me, to finish me. I looked up at him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he looked like a god to me now, a god from another world. It was his alien texture, his large and terrible neck ridges, his inhuman scales, the great flared width of him, his coiled power. It was his <em>eyes</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the menace in them&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no it was <em>fire</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;cold, timeless fire. He looked like something <em>magnificent</em> over me, something so other than human. I could only fall back and surrender myself to something so magnificent. Clearly these were my orgasms talking&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t lay claim to even the last shred of my own sanity underneath him now. Given how he&rsquo;d made me come as he&rsquo;d done, over and over and over, forgive me but how was he <em>not </em>a fucking god?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thighs yielded to him, I was ready, I was so powerlessly ready for him. He pushed, he pushed himself&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>ohhhhhhhh</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he breached, he opened, he entered, he took territory, he took it over&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;oh god it was everything, <em>everything</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was so inside me, so <em>deep </em>inside me, so everywhere inside me, he was all my body knew anymore, oh finally finally I had him all, all inside me, so inside me, <em>where was I anymore&hellip;</em>I was so <em>under </em>him, so overcome by him, so consumed, so invaded, so taken.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now he really <em>did</em> invade&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was taking me the way I&rsquo;d wanted it all along, <em>before</em>, before I&rsquo;d forgotten how to be angry with him. He was killing me the way I had wanted <em>before</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;hard, rough, unyielding, brutal, punishing. He wasn&rsquo;t stroking me, rocking me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was pounding me, smashing me, taking me with force, with his overtaking power. He grabbed my face and crushed his mouth over mine and shoved his tongue inside me so savagely that I could only suck on it, not a kiss, it was hard to breathe, it was hard to move, his arm was on some of my hair and I couldn&rsquo;t move my head&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was going to destroy me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he was going to destroy me and it would make him come and he would reduce me to nothing. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted anymore. I was caught and now I wanted to be<em> loved</em>, not killed. He was hate fucking me. I knew that&rsquo;s what I had wanted! I had wanted to hate fuck him too, I had wanted that. But not now, not anymore&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>so help me all I wanted to do now was love fuck this man.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurt. Not physically, it didn&rsquo;t hurt physically. But it did hurt. I was going to cry, it was going to happen. I hate crying. But it didn&rsquo;t matter. I had no defenses left. I had no strength. He was killing me. He had already killed me but he was doing it again. I felt hot tears welling, I felt them spill over.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw them. He had come up off my face, maybe to get some air himself, when he saw my tears. To my amazement I read something new in his eyes, something like <em>concern.</em> He let up on the pounding.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Am I hurting you?&rdquo; he asked me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>excuse me?!</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>where was I anymore&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;with this man asking me this question</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. I looked at him through the water in my eyes.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, why not just tell him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; </em>I whispered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed his arm trapping my hair. &ldquo;Oh, sorry&hellip;&rdquo; he moved it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;No&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no, that&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that&rsquo;s not it&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited, watching me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing my eyes, tears fleeing my lashes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could think of only one way to explain it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening my eyes.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> &ldquo;I want you,&rdquo;</em> I breathed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time froze, I swear it did.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes just&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;changed. Where was he? <em>Who was he?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</em> he asked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching his eyes. &ldquo;I want you.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t identify what was in them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me again."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>What had my words just unlocked in him?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping quietly."I want you. <em>I want you.</em>"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He searched my face, I had no idea what for. Then he started kissing it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;softly, warmly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held my face in his hands, tenderly, caringly. He kissed my jaws, my cheeks, my brows, my forehead, my temples. His voice was so sweet, his breath so gentle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry&hellip;don&rsquo;t cry&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed my tears, everywhere they&rsquo;d fallen he kissed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed my eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Nerys&hellip;I want you too&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed my lips.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garak.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>It was fucking Garak. </em>Garak was Eros. Garak was Eros and he&rsquo;d shot him, he&rsquo;d shot him today! I remembered now. I still had the memory&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it had been patchy but most of it was coming back.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I&rsquo;d been so angry in Ops, with everyone so coldly professional, analyzing problems, weighing options&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;forgetting Justin&rsquo;s absence and accepting Dukat&rsquo;s presence&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;while I&rsquo;d gone into my head imagining ways to physically hurt him, he and Garak had gotten into a verbal altercation.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dukat had sneered at him. <em>&ldquo;TAILOR!&rdquo;, </em>he&rsquo;d spat with contempt. He&rsquo;d said he should have had him executed, and Garak had retorted, <em>&ldquo;you tried that, remember?&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why&hellip;why had he said that&hellip;about executing him&hellip;why?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Because of Kira.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garak had been fed up with the abuse, angry. He&rsquo;d said Kira would <em>never</em> go for Dukat, <em>never </em>be impressed with him. How had he put it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;she had better taste&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;yes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>she has much better taste than to be attracted to you</em>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garak had <em>shot him</em> with those words, in front of Kira, in front of everyone.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not that Garak had <em>made</em> him want her. I remembered Dax smirking up at the commander&rsquo;s office where he&rsquo;d gone to talk alone with Kira&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Dax had known. He&rsquo;d already wanted her, but when Garak shot him it made him <em>fucking crazy</em> about it. He must have felt so angry and frustrated&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;even hurt&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he must have wanted to chase her but known he couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>His soul must have been itching.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;she had visibly <em>recoiled</em> at the idea, I remembered. Her face had said it all&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>of course</em> she didn&rsquo;t feel the same way, <em>of course </em>she didn't want him, she would <em>never</em> have wanted him. But Garak&rsquo;s words were the poisonous shot, the arrow of hate. She was disgusted, repulsed. She would rather die&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>or anything</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;than be caught by him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Kira was Daphne. </em>Garak had shot them both. And I&rsquo;d been caught in the fallout. My body slam had been all the provocation he hadn't known he was waiting for. I'd pushed him and that's all it had taken&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he'd just sort of snapped. I'd wanted to physically assault him. He'd wanted to catch Daphne and love her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood fantasy about Apollo had lacked in detail - well - no, it had lacked in dimension. Only one detail had been important, crucial, <em>essential</em> - Apollo caught me and I fell, I always fell, always fell under him, always in the darkness, always in his arms. The precious needed dimension wasn&rsquo;t there because only my desire knew what was missing, my desire had always known before I did, before I could fill in the blank. I&rsquo;d only known he was loving me, but my desire - my desire had known he was <em>fucking</em> loving me, <em>truly fucking loving me</em>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my body was learning his fucking love. He was holding me, holding me under him, in the darkness of him in his arms, wrapping me, kissing me, filling me, fucking me. It was everything my desire had known, what it called out for from the beginning of ever. My legs had always wrapped him, always held him, but my desire had known - always understood that my legs encircled him to draw his deepest reaches into mine, to hold his love inside me completely. He loved me <em>inside</em> me, my desire had known.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed me like this time <em>he</em> knew he'd be ripped off of <em>me </em>and it would break him, that my open and giving lips would slip away from his, that my warm wanting of him would shimmer and vanish, that the spell would be broken - at any moment, <em>at any moment - </em>and my kisses be lost to him forever. He kissed me like he suspended each kiss, memorized each precious joining of our lips, storing their essence and form secure in his heart against future famine sure to return - to sustain him when he would once more starve for love, when he would need reason to live.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was overcome with his embrace. I wanted him all. I wanted to wrap him and hold him, hold him close, hold him down.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rolled him over to rest on him, to rest on his darkness, to sink into the night, the warm loving night.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I was sinking, I was also dying. I spoke truth to him with my lips - <em>I want you, I want you</em> - but I lied love to him with my body. He wasn&rsquo;t with me. He was with Kira. My body lied to him as Kira, loving him, hurting him, hurting myself. I&rsquo;d learned as a child to show feelings that weren&rsquo;t true, and I&rsquo;d learned as a child how much that would <em>hurt</em>. I&rsquo;d done it to preserve myself, to stay safe from harm - but lies about love never preserve, they only destroy. They hurt with a hurt that never heals. It hurts to lie, it hurts to be lied to, and it hurts to do the hurting. And I lied <em>now</em>, lied about <em>who I was, </em>lied about my very self<em>.</em> It was ending me, it would reduce me to nothing. I didn&rsquo;t want that. I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt, I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt <em>him</em>, I didn&rsquo;t want to die<em>. </em>I wanted to live, I wanted to have him and hold him, I wanted to fucking love him, as Agat.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>as Agat, like Dukat</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Feel me, sweetheart, feel me - I want you, feel me.</em> My breasts were on his throat, calling for him, ravishing him. My hands were in his hair, holding his head. I looked, I didn&rsquo;t see myself in his eyes yet. I brought a breast to his mouth, he took it, he sucked it. I brought my mouth to his neck ridge, <em>my fucking ridge, </em>by his ear, I took it, I sucked it, I licked it. We breathed together, sighing together, rocking each other, holding, sucking, licking. I rode him, I stroked him, I took him, I swallowed him, I <em>came</em> over him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him moaning, moaning - I could feel it, I could taste it. He moaned, he pushed, he pushed me up so he could look in my eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Agat - Agat! - &rdquo;</em> he cried my name to me. <em>&ldquo;Agat!"&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He treasured my breasts in his hands, he held them, he sculpted them.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked in his eyes. I was in them. He looked. <em>He saw me.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Agat&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Agat&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;you&rsquo;re beautiful&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>how many more ways would he kill me?</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pressed myself down to him again and kissed his little ridge - on his nose, <em>once</em> - under his nose, <em>twice</em>. I took his lips, they were mine now, for Agat, and I kissed him to keep him. I rode him and loved him until he took me by the ribs and rolled me under him again. I could read the purpose, the heat, in his eyes. I could feel him coming, coming to claim me, cresting the hill. He kissed me deeply, loving my lips, loving my mouth. He buried his face next to mine, his breath on my neck, his hair on my cheek, his cheek on my ear, <em>oh god and he came and he claimed</em>, he claimed me so deep, so deep and so hard, he took and he claimed and he filled, he poured himself in, he shook and he fell and I caught him, I held him, I held him to <em>me</em>, to Agat.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrapped his arms around me, he embraced me, he loved me, he had me, he held me.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I just let him fucking hold me.</em>
