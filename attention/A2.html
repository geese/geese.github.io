    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long stretch I could hear Dukat&rsquo;s voice issuing an endless stream of words, unintelligible to me in my emotional state. I also heard Garak raising his voice. I heard others yelling. Over it all, the disruptor shots continued firing. Then abruptly, as though our nightmare train had finally hurtled off its broken track into a bottomless chasm, the disruptor noises stopped and relative quiet settled over us all. After a few seconds I saw Bashir&rsquo;s hand reaching into my hiding space and touching my forearm. It took some effort to raise my face and look up at him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agathe? Come on. Let&rsquo;s see if we might be able to do something to stop the self-destruct sequence.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shit, he was right. We still had a major problem! Okay. I crawled out and straightened myself.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait. Wait a minute. Dukat. Like&hellip;<em>Dukat? What the hell?&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Julian! Hold on! Did I hear Gul Dukat in here? With us? Was he actually&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>here</em>?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s here! He still is. Talking to Kira. Up there.&rdquo; He indicated Sisko&rsquo;s office, pointing with his chin.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why is he here?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You mean why is he <em>still </em>here? Obviously to press his advantage. He&rsquo;s not about to help us out of the kindness of his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t tracking yet.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Um. Sorry, I mean&hellip;what&rsquo;s he even <em>doing</em> here? At all?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julian squinted at me as if I&rsquo;d asked him the oddest question ever.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You heard him, didn&rsquo;t you? He said he got a distress call from himself? Saying the Bajoran workers had revolted? He knew it wasn&rsquo;t actually happening, but he came over here regardless because, you know&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;because he&rsquo;s a dick,&rdquo; Dax finished, joining us at the table. &ldquo;He told us he could easily shut down the self-destruct sequence, but he wanted to talk to Kira first&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>naturally</em>.&rdquo; She smirked knowingly up at the commander&rsquo;s office and then fixed a quizzical gaze on me, repeating Julian&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;How did you not hear what he said?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of us had just DIED. Had they&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;had they <em>not noticed</em>?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;I guess I was in shock. You saw what happened to Justin&hellip;? I&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words failed me. <em>Should I have needed to explain it to them?</em> A fellow officer had been vaporized in front of our eyes. We had all been hiding from the same endless volley of disruptor fire that had just killed him. Was it so inconceivable that some of us might <em>not</em> have immediately shifted our full attention to this Cardassian fucker when he entered the scene? That we might <em>not</em> have carefully hung on to his every word? Had I missed some part of Starfleet training?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently I <em>had</em> missed something. Dax pressed her lips together and glanced at Bashir. He chose his words carefully and spoke to me softly.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Things happen, Agathe. We all know the risks when we join Starfleet. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re specifically trained to keep our wits about us under conditions of severe stress. I didn&rsquo;t observe you exhibiting clinical signs of shock.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he was essentially telling me I should have been able to keep my shit together. Like, clinically together. I stood looking back at the two of them, letting it sink in. Okay. Although he&rsquo;d upbraided me like a smug little prick (he isn't one, I was just upset), I knew he wasn&rsquo;t wrong. It <em>was </em>essential that everyone be able to function through stuff like this. For instance, right now, with the station&rsquo;s destruction looming over us. Our lives depended on each of us deploying our mental acuity on demand. Like Dax had done. I guessed she was made of stronger stuff than I was. She&rsquo;d burned her hands a while ago and allowed herself only about ten seconds of whimpering before she was back in action.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt small. I felt small and blindsided and targetlessly angry. I took a deep breath and decided I&rsquo;d mine some strength from my anger, if nothing else, and recommit to making myself useful. That sounds brave, doesn&rsquo;t it? It was a nice thought. In truth I think I was way more emotionally cracked up than I had any hope of self-diagnosing. My inner being was all askew, and I struggled to get a grip.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I absolutely did not <em>ever</em> get that grip. Dukat swaggered out from his little conference with Kira, announcing that he would leave us and return &ldquo;in say, twenty-five minutes&rdquo;, giving us time to resign ourselves to his position that today was a good day to be fucked over, that we should accept whatever terms he&rsquo;d offered Kira in exchange for helping us out. Instead he fucked <em>himself </em>over when he tried to leave, by triggering an even deeper-level security protocol programmed to tell him he sucked ass as a Cardassian and would have to stay and die with the rest of us. His own personal access codes had just been revoked, so he couldn&rsquo;t leave anymore, and now even <em>he</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;fucking former Prefect and commander of Terok Nor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;could no longer just stop the self-destruct sequence. So now he was in our boat.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except it was more like, now he was on our &lsquo;team&rsquo;. The next thing I knew, the whole group of us were gathered at the ops table to figure stuff out. Like this was normal. Analyze our problem, discuss options, exchange ideas&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;like we were fucking colleagues. All of us. Minus Justin. Plus Dukat. It was nuts. It was fucking nuts. I couldn&rsquo;t feel normal about it! How could the rest of them feel normal about it? Maybe they didn&rsquo;t, but it sure seemed like they did. <em>How?! </em>Justin had died for no fucking reason at all. It hadn&rsquo;t been a battle. It hadn&rsquo;t been a training exercise. It hadn&rsquo;t even really been an accident. It had been a <em>fuckup</em>. A senseless <em>aberration, </em>authored by&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no, fucking <em>prerecorded</em> by Gul Dukat. In the past. He had fucking reached in <em>from the past</em> and randomly erased <em>Justin</em>. And now&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;seriously, I didn&rsquo;t understand it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;was it because of <em>Starfleet training</em> that everyone else was able to put it behind them and move on, like, <em>this easily</em>, <em>this quickly? </em>When I couldn&rsquo;t? What was so fucking wrong with me, then? How was I so deficient?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I didn&rsquo;t want to make a scene. But oh, I was frustrated, I felt&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I felt unjustly subdued, put down. My feelings weren&rsquo;t considered appropriate or professional at this time, Bashir had made that very clear.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really wanted to cry. But I don&rsquo;t cry. I mean, I do cry, but I hate to be <em>seen</em> crying.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to clarify&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;we weren&rsquo;t <em>all</em> actively participating in this little collegial brainstorming session. I stood mutely, just watching Dukat. The man across the table wasn&rsquo;t the discomfiting &lsquo;primed mass of threat&rsquo; from which I&rsquo;d previously recoiled. He couldn&rsquo;t be that, as he was currently in no position to threaten anyone. No, <em>this</em> man was like&hellip;like what?&hellip;like a systems specialist. A consultant. Someone with extensive knowledge of our station who&rsquo;d graciously responded to a polite request to come help us in our hour of need.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was <em>so fucking weird</em>. The space around him sparked with intense collaborative energy. He moved with this kind of joyful animated lightness&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve known the feeling&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;at times when I&rsquo;ve had to really ramp up my mind and apply it to urgent problem solving, it can be energizing, it can be kind of a high. I guess he was in the right time and place for that, the fucker. I watched his neck. Sometimes he&rsquo;d punctuate a statement with a little thrust of his jaw, if he was excited, and then his neck did this little rolling motion. <em>Why the fuck was I watching his neck?</em> Maybe because I wanted to wring it, even though it didn&rsquo;t look particularly wringable. Anyway, he stood and spoke and looked at us all like he was in his fucking element. Back straight, shoulders wide, chest open&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a posture of commanding confidence. And why not&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Dax was clearly geeking out on the interaction with him, like it was so intellectually stimulating. He probably felt like we were drinking in his input as if he alone dispensed the answers to life&rsquo;s most important questions. And actually he <em>did</em> dispense the answers to our most important questions just then. So it wasn&rsquo;t even like he was wrong about that. <em>Fucker.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was angry, very angry in the face of all this acceptance and collaboration with Dukat, very frustrated, very hurt, very upset. Maybe scared too? We <em>were</em> staring death in the face. But I don&rsquo;t remember being so specifically worried about our impending doom. I was suffocating with a powerless misery because I was feeling this way when nobody else seemed to be, and the way Bashir had put it, I was supposed to be able to deal with it. But clearly I couldn&rsquo;t, and I felt like I needed a target but I didn&rsquo;t have one. It was just <em>me</em> with the problem. Just me, I was the one to be angry at, frustrated with. I was angry with myself and it was eating me up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at Dukat across the table and felt like, <em>fuck that.</em> Fuck that anger at myself. I mean, there&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>right there, </em>just a few feet away&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;stood the true progenitor and nucleus of our disaster. <em>There. Him. </em>Couldn&rsquo;t we all just please be mad at <em>him? </em>Couldn&rsquo;t we at least <em>fuck him up</em> first and then collaborate with him? Did we have to be so mature about this, so <em>professional</em>? My friend was gone. This fucker was responsible. UGH.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at him and the table wasn&rsquo;t there anymore. Our eyes met&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;actually his eyes locked onto mine for what should have been some uncomfortably long moments&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but I&rsquo;d gone inside my head and mostly saw what was happening internally. I&rsquo;d jumped him. I&rsquo;d shoved him into a wall. You know, one of the convenient props that appear in our fantasies. I&rsquo;d shoved him into a wall <em>fucking hard</em>, and I was holding him against it, holding him with my entire body, pressing into him, grinding myself against him so I could bruise him fucking everywhere on his body. Never mind his armor, it wasn&rsquo;t there. Then my hands were on his neck, trying to wring it, but he was fighting back now, he had taken my arms and was wringing them like I&rsquo;d tried to wring his neck, and he was twisting them and pushing me back, forcing me down, forcing me to the floor, wrestling me, getting on top of me, he was fucking strong&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he had me on my back under him, his weight was on me, he had me <em>pinned</em>, he&nbsp;&ndash;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oooh, the memory of Justin in my mind didn&rsquo;t miss this at all. I heard his dry voice, his commentary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I see how it is&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;now that I&rsquo;m gone, you want to fuck him.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Oh shit, no.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it's not like that! It&rsquo;s not that I want to <em>fuck</em> him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ndash;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could just see memory Justin&rsquo;s withering gaze out of the corner of my eye&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;my mind&rsquo;s eye that couldn&rsquo;t look my mind&rsquo;s Justin in my mind&rsquo;s Justin&rsquo;s eye&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;yeah, I knew this shit was crazy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>It&rsquo;s &lsquo;not like that&rsquo;? Hmm. Kinda looks EXACTLY like that. Don't feel bad, it's probably just stress. Just your &lsquo;fight or flight&rsquo; response. Well, maybe &lsquo;fuck or flight&rsquo; in your case&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Psst&hellip;Agathe&hellip;&rdquo; </em>Garak hissed, elbowing me back to reality. I caught my breath and blinked hard. Thank goodness we didn&rsquo;t have a telepath in our group. As discreetly as possible, I reviewed my patchy memory of what my ears had heard while I was zoned out. The reason Dukat was looking at me was because the two of us were to go do some specific thing at one of the duty stations&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what had Dax said just now, dammit&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;oh! yes, we would bring the Cardassian neutralization emitters online so they would overload the power grid. We hoped to trigger a power surge so maybe we&rsquo;d short out the forcefields trapping us in Ops and <em>maybe</em> also take out the dampening field that currently made our communicators useless. Right. Well. Hopefully my little impromptu fantasy had cooled me off enough to cooperate with the fucker and do this thing. He and I walked over to the duty station where we could open up a lower panel to access the emitters.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got there first, just a couple steps ahead of him. As he arrived, he rudely crowded me out of the space I was standing in, pushing me aside with his body and taking my place, like I was irrelevant, like I didn&rsquo;t exist.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohhhhhh. <em>There </em>it was&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;all the provocation I hadn&rsquo;t even known I was waiting for. He'd pushed me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that was all it took&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I just sort of snapped. With no conscious thought, I angled myself for optimal impact and rammed him with a body slam that he had zero chance to anticipate. He stumbled forward, caught himself on the workstation and then whipped around to stare at me disbelievingly.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What was <em>that</em> for?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T. SHOVE ME. ASSHOLE.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t touch you.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You fucking shoved me out of your way.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tipped his head to the side. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s true, then you must have been <em>in</em> my way, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shoved him again, my hands on his armor. This time he held his balance, immovable. I pushed again, to no effect aside from his evident amusement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How <em>interesting</em> that you keep trying to displace <em>me</em>. I would think you&rsquo;d want me exactly where I am. After all, I set up this program&mdash;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>I know you did, </em>you SICK FUCK.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little harsh.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! <em>That&rsquo;s</em> harsh,&rdquo; I laughed, darkly. &ldquo;You think? We heard all those messages you recorded. You were going to lock women and children in their quarters and <em>gas</em> them! <em>'Think of your families!'</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bristled at the direct quote. &ldquo;That was to be a last resort! If you heard it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was reaching out directly to the workers first. I was going to offer leniency!&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Only to feel good about yourself! You wanted the Bajorans to <em>like</em> you. No&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;you wanted them to <em>love </em>you. You just wanted them to perform their role in your sick little play act, with you as both their executioner AND their savior! First you&rsquo;d scare the shit out of them and then you&rsquo;d forgive them and spare their lives, and then they&rsquo;d <em>worship </em>you!&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well fuck, that touched a nerve. I read danger in his face. I wasn&rsquo;t pushing him anymore. He was advancing on <em>me </em>now, intimidatingly, compelling me to step back from him as he pressed forward. Clearly my words were wounding his pride, which only fueled me on. Oh, I <em>wanted </em>to wound him somehow, in some way. I dialed up the mockery in my voice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you<em> actually think</em> anyone would halt the rebellion to listen to <em>you?</em> Did you think you'd sway them with your <em>masterful oratory</em>? Did you think they&rsquo;d be overcome by the trembling beauty of your voice, the <em>wetly shining ardor</em> in your eyes? How long did it take you to craft all those speeches? Did you toil away for countless sleepless nights? You <em>rehearsed </em>them, didn&rsquo;t you? You <em>practiced your performances </em>before recording them.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt the opposite duty station against my back&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he&rsquo;d forced my retreat as far as it could go. As he continued his encroaching press, I raised my hands to deflect him, but he seized my wrists, gripping them roughly and grating the sides of my palms against his armor. I struggled briefly to widen the space between us, but there was no winning any part of this contest of strength. He had me and he had me good.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fuck</em>, <em>it was true, I didn&rsquo;t exactly hate this.</em> Memory Justin was right, my emotional signals <em>were</em> crossed&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no wonder that tussle in my mind had looked like a prelude to hate fucking. Clearly I could never win any sort of physical struggle with this man&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I could never damage him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he could only ever destroy me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but still <em>I hungered so badly</em> to fight him, revealing the glaringly obvious truth that my body wanted to &lsquo;fight&rsquo; him in a very different way.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Yes</em>,&rdquo; he hissed. His eyes were hard and he bared his teeth a little. &ldquo;Yes, I did prepare. I wanted to sound sincere. It was important to me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You &lsquo;<em>wanted to sound&rsquo; </em>sincere!&rdquo; I threw my head back and laughed. This was too much. &ldquo;Listen to yourself! Do you hear how creepy that is? You had to <em>practice </em>your 'sincere' voice. You had to <em>work </em>at your 'sincere' voice so you could convince the Bajorans how much it would hurt your feelings when you had to kill them&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;could they please just change their minds and give up, because you cared so much! <em>So sincerely!</em>&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My laughter cut off in a gasp as he tightened his iron grip on my wrists and crushed himself unyieldingly against me. He spoke in a low rumble next to my face, his breath on my cheek.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How about I &lsquo;sincerely&rsquo; <em>break you</em>. Hmm?&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers bored into my flesh painfully. His hands began a wrenching motion that I knew would snap my bones if he chose to.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how it makes me feel. You can let me know if I sound&hellip;<em>sincere</em>.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, he sounded sincere. His body felt sincere, too. I had no doubt he was about to break some part of me. He&rsquo;d break my spine if he bent me the wrong way too forcefully. He&rsquo;d break my wrists if he tortured them any harder. He&rsquo;d break my will if he trapped me like this any longer. He was restricting all my possible moves, all my avenues of defense&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;save one. In my rising panic I found an opening. His neck was exposed to me. I was tall enough, I could reach&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I brought my face to it and bit him fucking hard on the large ridge along the side.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking him into my mouth was what broke me. The feel of him drove it home&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I mean, now I <em>knew</em> I didn't hate this. <em>This</em> was where I ached to begin our fight, with the thick tough fullness of him between my teeth, he and I each both inflicting pain and convulsing with it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the same joined waves of shattering pain. His hand tore up into my hair, catching a tight fistful and yanking my head back, violently ripping me off of him. I sensed the hot threat of him against my open throat, the taste memory of his texture dancing on my tongue. Then I heard it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;my defeat&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I heard myself voicing it recklessly in a pleading, guttural moan, a deeply wrung expression of a wracking <em>need</em> for him to take and finish me. My free hand gave me away as well&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the one he&rsquo;d dropped to grab my hair&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it obeyed raw impulse by feeling its way blindly to his ass, pulling on him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I panted helplessly, guessing that he sure as hell couldn&rsquo;t be missing any of <em>these</em> subtle nuances.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was right, he wasn&rsquo;t. The new information apparently swept away his rage at my bite.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He released his grip on my hair so he could palm the back of my head and pull it forward into its natural alignment. Letting go of my wrist, he brought his other hand up to the front of my neck, cupping it, pushing his thumb onto my lower lip. He watched me close my eyes and fight the urge to suck on it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I see&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices in our periphery began to fade in&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;our names&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Dukat!</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Agathe!</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I realized the others had been shouting at us since they&rsquo;d noticed our little skirmish. It seemed that he became aware of them now, as well. He moved both hands to either side of my face, eyeing me with a disarming new interest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat.&rdquo; He uttered my name softly. &ldquo;I thought I heard <em>&lsquo;Dukat&rsquo;</em>.&rdquo;
    
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I froze like a small animal in his hands. His sudden probing tenderness made me nervous. He had my name. He spoke it like it made him feel good.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;<em>Agat</em>&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is unusual for humans. Most people initially stumble over how to say it, endure a few awkward corrections, convince themselves they&rsquo;ve got it, inevitably forget it, and thereafter endlessly remind me how difficult it is to remember. It&rsquo;s just spoken in the French way&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a regular Earth language&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not complicated. But no one I've ever met has understood the sound of it. And if they see it written, the spelling suggests three syllables beginning with an &lsquo;A&rsquo; as in &lsquo;apple&rsquo;, containing the &lsquo;th&rsquo; sound as in &lsquo;thing&rsquo;. Sadly, this version has long gone out of favor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;meaning no matter how anyone said it when I was young, I had a &lsquo;weird name&rsquo; in addition to my unfortunate looks, just another undesirable feature to taunt me about. The shame it triggered for those years remains and persists, like a decorative ring on that hidden worm in my gut, the worm that nudges me to shrink away whenever anyone looks too closely, whenever they can <em>see</em> me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>He thought he heard &lsquo;Dukat&rsquo;. </em>The irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on me that he&rsquo;d stumbled onto a pretty decent mnemonic aid which might prove useful next time I introduced myself. <em>My name is Agathe, like &lsquo;Dukat&rsquo;.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, inquiringly, he slid his hands down along my cheeks, fingers smoothly combing through my hair as they passed my ears, tracing down my neck, venturing onto my collarbones.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh shit, this strangely gentle treatment was going to make me fucking cry. I felt the first stinging pricks of the unwanted tears behind my eyes, like besieging enemy helmets cresting the last remaining hill ahead of my castle gates. It was the wounding sweetness of my name in his voice. Not only that, but the dissonance of these soothing touches against the bone-bruising holds echoing in my wrists. And under it all, the crack in my heart from the sudden loss of my friend.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>No!&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t let him break me this way too.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dropped my gaze, carefully studying the curious little ridge that trailed all the way over the tip of his nose and down to touch his upper lip.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agat&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I memorized that fucking ridge. <em>How could THIS man be the one to pierce me like this, with my name? </em>What happened to &lsquo;Attention, Bajoran workers&rsquo;? He was undoing me.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;I apologize, for shoving you.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! That saved me. Now I could shake the moment off, with this reminder of how we&rsquo;d gotten here. I took hold of his wrists as he&rsquo;d done to me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not to bruise him, but to break contact, to cast his hands away from me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever. Stop touching me.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pushed his arms back sharply. He didn&rsquo;t resist. But he didn&rsquo;t back off either. I glimpsed his smirk as he brought his face to my ear just as he had when proposing to break me.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo; he teased, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that sounded very <em>sincere</em>&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>&hellip;fuck you</em>,&rdquo; I hissed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he stepped off in the direction of the emitters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quickly turned away to hide the discolored mayhem in my face&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that is, to hide it from him. Everyone else got a full view.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kira wasn&rsquo;t having any of this shit. &ldquo;Dukat, we're running out of time,&rdquo; she barked at him from the table, glaring at me flatly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t take long,&rdquo; he answered her. &ldquo;I know what I'm doing here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His statement gave me an excuse to break eye contact with Kira, so I looked over at him again. He <em>had</em> moved quickly. He was already sitting on the floor efficiently wiring the emitters into the control panel. I retraced the steps we&rsquo;d taken in our little conflict, crouching near him warily, assessing whether or not I should try to join in&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;knowing that too many hands can be a hindrance. Probably it would be better to stay out of his way.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Out of his way&hellip; </em>So we&rsquo;d come full circle. I&rsquo;d body slammed him before&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;when I had been <em>in</em> his way. He hadn&rsquo;t been wrong. <em>I&rsquo;d been wrong. </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Me, wrong again&hellip; </em>Now I came full circle around an earlier circle&hellip;<em>what was so fucking wrong with me then, so deficient</em>?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around another, even earlier circle. <em>I felt small&hellip;angry at myself, consumed with powerless misery&hellip;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuck that.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wanted to feel better, feel okay again. The sight of Dukat on the floor suggested a short-term remedy. Once again I let my body&rsquo;s ideas dictate my private reality, indulging my mind while he focused on the emitters. I crawled onto him and pushed on his armor as before, this time achieving the desired result of laying him all the way down on his back. I fingered my hands into his hair, softly at first, then cruelly in an abrupt double grasp, forcing his head against the floor with painful impact, slamming it a couple more times because it felt good to hurt him, holding him down with <em>my</em> iron grip this time, compelling him to lock eyes with me, wordlessly daring him to say my name&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>cry</em> my name&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;as I mounted and rode him so hard I could break <em>him</em> at any moment. Needless to say certain technicalities weren&rsquo;t an issue&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;my fantasy, my rules&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he didn&rsquo;t push me off, he was <em>of course</em> already hard and willing, our uniforms weren&rsquo;t in the way, somehow his arms were restrained above him although I still held his head by the hair&hellip;how was that possible?&hellip;I glanced past him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;oh, obviously I&rsquo;d cuffed his hands to the railing right there, perfect&hellip;my hips eased into a steady, deeply swallowing, fiercely deliberate rhythm, swearing no mercy until I&rsquo;d wrenched as traitorous a moan from his throat as he&rsquo;d wrested from mine&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All right, I'm ready,&rdquo; Dukat announced.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Wait, what? </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All the emitters are attached to the power grid,&rdquo; he informed us, over his shoulder. &ldquo;I should be able to trigger the power surge now.&rdquo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Brace yourselves,&rdquo; Dax cautioned.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dukat reacted to her warning, turning back to reach around for the railing on his left&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no notion of having been handcuffed to it moments earlier&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;planting his feet a little wider to secure his seated stance. While doing so, he caught my arousal-drugged gaze, a glint in his eyes hinting that he intuited my unguarded, <em>unfinished</em> state.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You too, Agat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let go of the railing long enough to snatch me with both hands and pull me over to him, settling me onto his right thigh without a moment to spare. His arm encircled me firmly to lock me in, my back to his chest, the angular protrusions of his armor jerking against me as the station underwent cataclysmic shaking and rocking. My belly fluttered wildly when I felt the muscular hardness of his thigh under my ass, bouncing roughly. I pursued the sensation mindlessly, shifting my hips, opening my thighs a little wider. With each jolting bump I greedily pressed myself against his quadricep with equal and opposite force. I couldn&rsquo;t tell if he noticed&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but I also didn&rsquo;t care. I stole a few seconds of relief&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;far too few&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;before all the noise and shaking stopped, leaving us all holding our breaths and listening to the remaining ambient noises, wondering if the power surge had done what we all hoped it had.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer was yes, it had&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Kira hit her combadge and finally got through to Sisko. The station&rsquo;s forcefields had shorted out, meaning we could leave Ops now&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but it was kind of too late. The main reactor core was still going to overload in about ten minutes, and nobody could possibly make it soon enough from here to level thirty-four, to the place where one last attempt could still be made to keep us from blowing up. Those of us here had done all we could do, other than wait for oblivion or&hellip;salvation, I guess. Possibly Sisko and O&rsquo;Brien would be able to get to that level and prevent our destruction&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they were on their way to try.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat listening to them, not really having any thoughts about getting up off of Dukat, at first. I was just sort of idly looking at the patterns on his boot and the pant leg I was sitting on. I looked at his arm on my waist too, at the seaming of the fabric on his sleeve, trying to decide whether or not that one pattern right there was technically a chevron, wondering what Cardassians called it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;was there a translation or did we just call it whatever they called it, or did &lsquo;we&rsquo; call it anything. This was a pretty good closeup view of Cardassian military fabric.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right about then was when I came back to myself and realized that I was <em>sitting in Gul Dukat&rsquo;s lap</em>. And the first thought I had was to look around for Justin, because he would <em>definitely</em> have seen the humor in this. And then of course it hit me again that he was gone. And then I remembered his voice in my head telling me &ldquo;<em>now that I&rsquo;m gone you want to fuck him.</em>&rdquo; And I had vehemently denied it, in my head. And then here I was on Dukat&rsquo;s thigh, and I had just been humping it. So now I felt grateful that Justin had never seen me fucking <em>humping Dukat&rsquo;s leg</em>, because he would <em>never </em>have let me live that down. Justin would have <em>owned</em> me. I could just see the expression on his face. I could just hear him winding up to let the jokes fly. He would have had <em>such</em> a sarcastic field day at my expense.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know whether I wanted to laugh or cry.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, let me go,&rdquo; I said to Dukat, starting to gather my limbs and adjust my center of gravity so I could get myself on my feet. He took his arm off me, so I thought I was free to go. I was able to partially raise myself, but then he suddenly reached up around my middle with his other arm&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his left&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and pulled me back down. It happened so fast that at first I thought I had just lost my balance and fallen back on him. But I hadn&rsquo;t fallen. He had only let me go so he could switch arms. After he got me back down it took me a couple moments to understand what was different, because it came as such a shock. My back was still to him, but <em>holy shit.</em> He&rsquo;d hooked his right arm <em>under</em> me from behind&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;under my thigh but kind of also under my ass. I couldn&rsquo;t sort out exactly how&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;or how so fucking quickly&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but he&rsquo;d placed me on himself in a way that gave him access to me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he <em>had</em> me. He unmistakably had <em>me</em> in his hand. I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;if I hadn&rsquo;t been clothed, he could have inserted digits.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Damn</em>, <em>he was strong.</em> I could&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<em>intimately</em>, let&rsquo;s say&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;perceive the robust strength of his forearm, his hand, his fingers&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his angle of attack did nothing to diminish his ability to move them with precision and force. The first thing he did was establish full-handed possession, holding me captive, and <em>not</em> gently. Then he got me with his left hand too. He brought it up around the front of my face and planted it on my right cheek to get a good hold, and then he yanked roughly, torquing my head back in his direction over my left shoulder, forcing me to look him in the face. The twist was so severe&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I tried to follow the turn with my shoulders to lessen it, but his body was in the way. I felt him close his thumb in on my chin, so now he held my face in a seriously crushing grip, still pulling on me, carving a strain into my neck, and no fucking way would he let me turn away by even the tiniest degree to ease it. 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  His face was mere inches from mine. I was looking at that little ridge under his nose again. This was fucking scary and it hurt. I couldn't process what was happening.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;These could be our final ten minutes,&rdquo; he told me in a low thrumming undertone. The other voices in the room merged into a blur&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they were loud and urgent and there was a lot of back and forth over the com&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but no one was aware of what Dukat was doing to me, here on the floor in the little sort of walled off area&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I think they forgot about him, forgot about me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his moves were quick and subtle and didn&rsquo;t attract notice&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I realized how alone I was with him. For all I knew, it was his greatest turn-on to grab a woman by the pussy and snap her neck&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and if that were true, what was to stop him from doing it <em>now</em> if he believed he could possibly have only ten minutes left to live and may as well amuse himself before he went out?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered me to look at him. I <em>was </em>looking at him. No, he wanted me to look him in the eyes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Look at me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bored steel fingertips into my face until I brought my eyes up.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>That&rsquo;s it. Look at me&hellip;</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relaxed his fingertips somewhat, but still held me in place sternly. Having secured my eyes, he eased up on the grip with his other hand, beginning to rub very slowly. I gasped at the sudden change in handling.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Shhhhh,&rdquo;</em> he soothed, continuing his unhurried probing touch.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was crazy. I mean what he was doing there felt good, I&rsquo;m not going to lie. I was already primed, so to speak&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;something about him turned me on, I&rsquo;d already been fucking him in my thoughts, I&rsquo;d already been grinding on his leg&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;clearly he had a head start here, and his slow deliberate pace was easily going to make me lose my mind.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was going to make me lose it on <em>his</em> terms. He taught me his rules with brutal clarity by simply hurting me when I broke one of them. A cruelly tightened grip on my face, a sharp violent jerk to my chin, a swift painful overtwist on my neck&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;these were his punishments. He punished me if I whimpered or moaned or made any noise at all with my voice. He punished me if I closed my eyes. He punished me if my eyes were open but not looking at his. <em>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo;</em> he&rsquo;d insist, always working his hand on me, sometimes increasing the pressure, sometimes the tempo, but always so steady, so controlled, so <em>measured</em>.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no choice but to read the cold inevitability in his eyes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;he would make me come and he would watch.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started punctuating each stroke with a harsh demanding squeeze. <em>Oh&hellip; fuck, his hand was so strong!</em> It made me want him to bend me over naked and slap me <em>hard,</em> fucking hold me down and hit me so hard, <em>too </em>hard, again and again and again until I was crying and begging incoherently, and then I wanted to feel him hold me and push, push on me like he was too big for me and angry about it, push, shove, <em>force</em> me open, drive the thick brutal length of himself in, in&hellip;<em>UGGHH</em>&hellip;I wanted him to slam me, pound me, <em>bone me so fucking hard&hellip;!</em> This is what he wrung from my eyes while he made me look at him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;watching me feel his big hand on me while aching for his cock&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I wanted to close my eyes and groan but he wouldn't let me&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no mercy in his eyes, so cold, so hard, watching me beg him without begging. I whimpered, I had to, <em>I had to, </em>and he punished me, he hurt me.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Why</em> didn&rsquo;t I resist? I don&rsquo;t know! The others weren&rsquo;t so totally far away, I could have cried for help, someone may have heard me. Why didn&rsquo;t I fight in some way? I had hands, why didn&rsquo;t I go for his kneecap, his balls, his eyes, hair, <em>something?</em> It was confusing. It was terrifying. But then I felt like I had <em>asked</em> for this&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;how could I deny it when I was the one who&rsquo;d picked a fight with <em>him </em>and grabbed <em>his</em> ass, I was the one who&rsquo;d fantasized about raping <em>him </em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;come on, I&rsquo;d cuffed him, slammed his head against the floor, ridden him too hard&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was the one who had pleasured myself on his thigh, who wanted to scream right now from needing him inside me so bad, who was about to <em>come in his hand&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>how could I possibly say I didn&rsquo;t want this?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I could. I <em>could</em> say I didn&rsquo;t want &lsquo;this&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want it this way. It felt so good and it felt so horrible. This wasn&rsquo;t even about being fucked. He wasn&rsquo;t fucking me. He was <em>doing</em> me. He was overpowering me in mind and body. He was making me <em>want</em> him to invade me, dominate me, own me, but he was also the one twisting my neck, muzzling me, humiliating me in the open. He fondled and constrained me into a wet, shaking, shivering mess, trying to hold my own mouth closed to choke down my sobs and moans and pleas as he required, struggling to take in enough air, panting through my nose raggedly in violent sniffing spasms, tears rolling from my eyes as he forced me to keep them open and fixed on his.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reduced me to shame by forcing me to lose control while he watched, forcing me to <em>want</em> it, forcing me to show it all to him in my eyes. He tapped into my private hidden shame of <em>me</em>, of my being, the deep part of me afraid to be revealed and <em>seen</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;how could I be more seen than this, what was more <em>seeing of me</em> than watching me <em>come </em>on command<em>, </em>than watching me with the assured knowledge that even despite this gutting violation, if I could once speak I would only beg him to <em>please</em>, <em>please, fuck me now, fuck me hard?&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh shit, I remembered he said he could break me and tell me how it made him feel and I could let him know if he sounded sincere&hellip;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He murmured me on.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Yes, that's it. That&rsquo;s good&hellip;that's good&hellip;yessss, Agat&hellip;look at me, Agat&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now rubbing faster, harder, he put even more muscle behind each pressing, stroking pass across my opening, over the wet fabric of my uniform&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was so ready&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was so close&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;my body shuddered with violent shaking gasps and still he incrementally increased speed and intensity, finally focusing the unrelenting rubbing, digging, stroking motion directly over my throbbing clit. Seeing and feeling me about to go over the edge, he lowered his gaze, dipping his face down to my left cheek, the one he wasn't gripping with his hand, and gently nuzzled his nose against it. <em>Oh God why, why? </em>Then he opened his mouth and slowly, wetly, hotly, he trailed his tongue up along my jaw from my chin to my ear. 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That was the end of me. I shattered into heaving screams and cries.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t hurt me. He released the pulling force on my face, moving his hand to the side of my head, holding it, smoothing my hair, pressing his face into mine on the side where he had just nuzzled, cooing softly, rocking me a little bit. I could only shake against him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My outburst had drawn the room's notice, of course.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>DUKAT!</em>"&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had never heard that tone from Dr. Bashir before.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one yelled my name, only Dukat&rsquo;s. I guess maybe they had an instinct about the dynamic they were staring at, even if they had no idea what the fuck was actually going on. I don't think he even flinched. I think he was completely at ease. That's the impression I get from the little I recall of those moments. Somehow I extracted myself from his hold, rolling off him and stumbling to my feet, blindly fumbling my way to a door, getting the hell out of Ops. 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I ran. I didn't have a particular destination in mind other than maybe a hole in the ground, which would have been nice, except we don't have any ground to put holes into. I turned a corner into an unlit empty corridor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;good enough. I threw myself to the floor and dissolved in the darkness, folding my head into my arms, huddled, crying, sobbing, rocking, broken, hiding, hiding my face. I wouldn't have known or cared if the station had blown up.&nbsp;
