<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got myself up and moving, eventually, letting my feet carry me to the upper level of the Promenade. I chose a window and stood looking out toward the wormhole. My duty shift was over. I was thinking I should get something to eat, then go to my quarters and wind down for the night so I'd be ready to work tomorrow like normal. I would certainly need a good night's sleep if I was going to walk my ass into Ops again as if I weren't a total wreck. And a hot shower might help with the muscle pain. I was going to push <em>him</em> out of my thoughts. Dukat. I'd already given him enough of me. I wasn't going to let him take away my ability to work, to function. Don't carry him around. He's gone. Just let him be gone.
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Problem was, it didn't feel like he was gone. I mean, okay yes he was gone, but... But it felt like he'd <em>left something behind</em>. Like he'd left something in <em>me, </em>like...like a barb that breaks off of a poisoned spear when you pull it out. No, that was too accidental...he was more calculating than that, he wouldn't just <em>lose a fucking barb</em>... No, it was like he'd performed surgery on me&nbsp;-&nbsp;like he'd cut me open and left a scalpel blade inside. 
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentionally. 
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt like he'd left some cutting, insidious little <em>part</em> of something in me, and what was worse was I couldn't help feeling like I wanted him to come back and take it out. Like if he would just <em>take it out</em>, then I could feel like nothing ever happened. 
    
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he took it out, I was going to feel like...well, like I did now...like my soul was itching.
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I heard voices approaching along the Promenade to my left, and turned my head to see who else was up here. <em>Big mistake</em>. I would need more than a shower for the neck, this was pretty bad. Not to mention my right cheek. Even my gums were sore on that side. Good thing I hadn't tried to eat yet. 
I hit my combadge. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Legrand to Dr. Bashir."&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Agathe! Yes, go ahead."

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Could I come see you in the infirmary? I need help. Do you mind?"
<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at all! I'm already here. Please, come on in."
<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Thanks, see you soon."
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't prepared for Julian's reaction when he saw me. The bloom of dismay in his eyes hit me in the gut. I hadn't thought I looked nearly as bad as I felt. But his expression told me otherwise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe! Your face&nbsp;-&nbsp;come, come sit here, let me look at it." He led me to one of the patient beds and I sat. 
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned in to examine me, while I studied his big open dark eyes, thinking about how wonderful it would be if some way, somehow, the beautiful warm <em>softness</em> of them could be spun and woven into a gauzy cashmere of magically all-encompassing gentle brown comfort and caressing stillness&nbsp;-&nbsp;I would drape my world in it and wrap it around myself and bury my face in gathered handfuls of it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You were right to come in, Agathe. This is some nasty swelling. And how did you get all this<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;oh this is going to bruise</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;this almost looks like&nbsp;-&nbsp;" I watched him begin to figure it out. "Are these <em>finger marks?</em> One, two, three...four...and down here...the <em>thumb</em>. This is a hand. This is clearly someone's hand."&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he connected the dots. He looked at me, horrified.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe, <em>is this Gul Dukat's hand?</em> Did he do this to you?<em>"</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes. It felt like too much work to say anything. I took a small breath and let it out again.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened my eyes and refocused on him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did Dukat leave these marks on you?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pressed my lips together and nodded.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you look at my neck, too? I think it might be strained."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern in his eyes deepened into a darker shade of alarm. He began palpating the sore area but when I winced in obvious distress he switched to one of his scanning instruments.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Agathe. This muscle is severely pulled." He shook his head. "You must be in agony."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, only if I move my head the wrong way."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me he did this too?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes again, wearily. Did I really need to itemize my injuries right now? Well...probably yeah. The doctor needed to know how they happened. Kinda relevant. And there <em>were</em> only two. <em>Were there only two? Was I forgetting one? </em>Not like a laundry list or anything. Still, I just didn't want to have to think about Dukat in connection with the specific sites of his transgression on my body. Somehow naming him as the cause felt like he was doing it all over again. I just wanted to shrink out of this moment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Julian... Yes. Dukat hurt me. He did the face, he did the neck."&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at him. <em>Please don't ask me any more about it...please just understand. Please just help. </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you help me? It hurts."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>Of course</em> I'll help you. That's what I'm here for."&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I relaxed some, while he ministered to my neck. I felt guarded over and protected, as if Julian's very body were a shield at my shoulder, an impenetrable barrier between me and a fearsome dark specter behind him, a bringer of pain. As he repaired the muscle, the specter faded away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he came around in front of me, leaning in closely as before. He held a regenerator in one hand, and brought his other hand up to the left side of my face, to my jaw, meaning to gently hold it so he could tend to my bruises.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Oh God that's where Dukat&nbsp;&mdash;</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I flinched with a small strangled cry and put my hands up to knock Julian's away. Okay, that was awkward. My hands flew to my mouth and covered it as I closed my eyes and breathed shakily.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry...I guess I'm jumpy."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled kindly. "It's quite alright. But I'll need you to hold still, okay?" He placed his hand tenderly on my cheek again. "Can you hold still for me, Agathe?"&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>His eyes were mere inches from mine...</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"God&nbsp;-&nbsp;no&nbsp;-&nbsp;stop!" </em>This time I pushed him on his chest, pushed him away from me. I jumped off the bed and fled to a chair.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe!" Julian brought over a second chair for himself and sat facing me. I wanted to cover my face again but he took my hands in his and held them between us on my lap. His eyes were so wide and soft with concern. I felt my lip start wobbling&nbsp;-&nbsp;I had to let it&nbsp;-&nbsp;it got away from me, there was nothing I could do. The rest of my face followed suit and crumbled, hot tears flooding over. I heard myself softly keening. I really hate to be exposed this way. But I couldn't hold it in anymore, Julian's warmth was too much to bear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe," Julian searched my face&nbsp;-&nbsp;not that my swimming eyes could see that well, I just kind of felt him doing it. "Agathe, what did he do to you?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Let me cover my face, let me cover my face... </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still held my hands. I hunched forward and rocked a little. I was beginning to sob in gasps.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"What did he do to you?" </em>Julian repeated with greater intensity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rolled my eyes and tried to chuckle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, you can see...you can see what he did..."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>That's not what he did. I can't tell you what he did.</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I <em>see,</em> is that there's more here than meets the eye." He was still searching my face, I could feel it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe, <em>what did he do?</em> Please tell me what he did."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I mean, obviously he fucked me up...</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what he did."&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That probably didn't make much sense. Probably wouldn't satisfy him. I tried to steady myself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julian gave it a few seconds before trying again.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know what he did?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned my face to my right&nbsp;-&nbsp;the safer side&nbsp;-&nbsp;resolutely eyeing the floor across the room.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe. Look at me, Agathe. <em>Look at me.</em>"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, no, no. <em>Not that again.</em> I folded myself over my lap, over our hands, as if doubled over in pain.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Oh God," </em>I groaned. "<em>Nooooo..."</em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>Agathe...</em>"&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt him remove a hand from our hold and start stroking my hair with it. I gripped his remaining hand in both of mine and rested my forehead on top. Maybe we could stay like this for a while. It was nice and warm and dark down here.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dammit, why didn't we leave him with the Maquis," he muttered. That got a weak laugh from me. "I mean it. I think I may kill him if I see him here again."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I felt calmer I sat up. Julian picked away some hairs that were stuck to my face where my tears had dried. In doing so he saw the hand marks. "Oh Agathe, let's take care of this. Come on. No, stay here. I'll get the regenerator."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I closed my eyes while he touched my face, and I was okay. When he was finished he put the instrument down and then held my face in both of his hands.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agathe? Can you look at me now?"&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded and took a deep breath. I opened my eyes. I was able to look at him.
