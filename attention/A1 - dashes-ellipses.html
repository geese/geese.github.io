  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you're holding is my written account of an experience I had recently&nbsp;-&nbsp;an encounter with someone. I went to Dr. Bashir for medical treatment in connection with it, and he advised me to contact you for mental health support. I'll be making an appointment to see you soon, but it's very hard for me to talk about what happened. That's why I've written about it. If you could read it before we meet, I think that will be very helpful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encounter happened on the day when the station was nearly accidentally destroyed by a Cardassian anti-insurgency program&nbsp;-&nbsp;a computer program left over from when this was Terok Nor, when Gul Dukat was in command here as Prefect of Bajor, and Bajorans labored here in ore processing. I'm sure you remember it. We lost life support, we overloaded the station's power grid, the main fusion reactor blew, lots of people had to evacuate. Maybe you were one of them. I'm guessing you also saw at least one of Dukat's prerecorded messages to the 'rebelling' Bajoran workers, telling them to surrender to the Cardassian authorities. I know people saw messages at Quark's. In a couple of them, he threatened to kill every Bajoran on the station with neurocine gas. It wasn't a good day. Not at all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work in Ops. That's where I was when everything began, when we saw the first of those messages. Actually, that very first one didn't concern us so much&nbsp;-&nbsp;it was just really <em>weird</em>. Now that I think of it, it's almost kind of funny remembering the same look on everyone's face, a collective sort of <em>'what the fuck...?' </em>response.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember looking for my friend Justin right away, to catch his reaction. I wasn't surprised to find him already grinning over at <em>me,</em> in the special way he always grinned and raised an eyebrow when he was ready to crack a joke. He was so good at it, such a smartass. I felt very comfortable with him&nbsp;-&nbsp;he was one of the few people I could really be <em>myself</em> with. I didn't realize at the time how much I felt this way about him. His toothy grin&nbsp;-&nbsp;that's what represents him in my mind. All of his exuberant, joyful friendliness, it was all in that smile.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cocked eyebrow, though&nbsp;-&nbsp;that could be trouble. I had one to match. We'd often meet each other's eyes across the room, and it would take all our strength to keep from giggling and losing it, very unprofessionally. We could just <em>read</em> each other and transmit waves of irreverence and sarcasm between ourselves, wordlessly. I nearly sent us both over the edge after another of Dukat's early messages when he said something like, "It's not too late to save your <em>lives</em>". His voice sounded so absurdly fervent on the word 'lives', I couldn't keep from poking fun at it. I focused my most smouldering gaze on Justin and mouthed "save your <em>lllllllife</em>" while exaggerating the letter 'L' with my tongue as lasciviously as I could, as if it had the most obscene double meaning. This came out rather more suggestively than I had anticipated, and with the tension in the room already pretty thick by now, we both got super hot in the face and had to turn away from each other to keep our composure.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wasn't long before either one of us didn't feel much like joking anymore, even to relieve tension. It became apparent that Sisko and O'Brien might be in some actual danger in the ore processing unit, and we couldn't get them out with the transporter. And then I started feeling even more unnerved when Dukat appeared on our monitors again, which is probably why I found myself standing next to Justin with no memory of having walked over to be with him. It felt better not to be <em>alone</em> when Dukat was present&nbsp;-&nbsp;even knowing that he wasn't actually present, and that I was in a room with other people&nbsp;-&nbsp;not actually alone.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justin muttered some uncharitable observations about Dukat's face. I remarked that I was more bothered by his neck. It kind of made me shudder. After that we didn't say anything, while we watched a particularly lengthy message together. It was at least a minute long, maybe two. He was very...wordy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd seen Cardassians before, so Dukat's physical features didn't surprise me. But I have to admit&nbsp;-&nbsp;and I'm ashamed to say it&nbsp;-&nbsp;I felt myself reflexively recoiling at the sight of him. Maybe that's understandable. I mean, I don't think anyone would argue that he didn't look rather <em>reptilian</em>, with so much of his visible skin surface blanketed in scales and outlined with rough bumpy ridges as if he were part lizard or...serpent. On a human, that generally wouldn't be a good look, right? We're not naturally drawn <em>toward</em> large creatures with this kind of appearance. Usually we feel the impulse to back away. And if you noticed that I just used the word 'creature'&nbsp;-&nbsp;well, that should serve to illustrate the counter-instinctual effort it took to be mature and evolved enough to see past his exterior and regard the man himself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to make that effort because I didn't want to be unfair. I was sensitive about it, because I can relate to not being seen past my <em>own</em> exterior. I looked pretty damn awkward as a kid&nbsp;-&nbsp;as a girl. I can say that with detachment now. I just really wasn't pretty. More like the opposite. And the people my age&nbsp;-&nbsp;the ones I spent the most time with&nbsp;-&nbsp;never let me forget it. No one was drawn <em>toward </em>me by my looks. My personality was okay, if anyone got to know me a little. I could make friends. But my experience taught me that good 'looks' are <em>the</em> most vital social capital resource for a human girl. Throw this girl in among <strike>wolves</strike>&nbsp;-&nbsp;sorry, <em>other children</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;deficient in this one fucking arbitrary resource, and she'll be handled just badly enough in her formative years to develop a neatly warped sense of self by the time adulthood arrives.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect was cumulative&nbsp;-&nbsp;all the years of being eyed and labeled as this unpleasant looking, undesirable person. It sort of put a quiet belief in me, like a worm hiding in my gut, that it was true&nbsp;-&nbsp;that I <em>was</em> unpleasant&nbsp;-&nbsp;not just to look at, but to <em>know</em>. Things changed socially after I grew up. Evidently, people find me attractive now&nbsp;-&nbsp;they tell me I am, they eye me like I am&nbsp;-&nbsp;and if I look at the mirror objectively&nbsp;-&nbsp;well yeah, I guess I've figured out how to pass myself off as an attractive woman. But that old worm still fidgets inside me. It squirms whenever anyone really <em>looks</em> at me. It makes me feel like I'll be discovered, exposed as an impostor, a fundamentally undesirable person posing as someone normal.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that's why I felt ashamed about recoiling at Dukat's appearance. It was unfair to be so shallow about it. I didn't want to concur with Justin about 'his face'&nbsp;-&nbsp;it didn't feel right to. And when I said 'his neck' bothered me, it wasn't so much the physical detailing&nbsp;-&nbsp;the scales and ridges and the grotesquely muscular flared width of it. No, it was what he <em>did </em>with it. It was the tilt of it. The coiled tension in it. The way he stretched it and held his head with a chilling sinewy poise, as if he'd strike at any moment&nbsp;-&nbsp;the secret deadly moment of his choosing&nbsp;-&nbsp;with the precision and control of a sharply intelligent and powerful snake. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It was his <em>motions</em> more than his form, and it was the rests <em>between</em> his motions more than even the motions. It was all his kinetic and <em>potential</em> energy&nbsp;-&nbsp;it was what he looked like he was <em>about</em> to do.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I'm trying to describe here is that, leaving aside his innate physical features, he appeared to me as <em>a primed mass of threat</em>. That was reason enough that I couldn't look at him without discomfort.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to him was worse. Like, creepy worse. To my ears he tried to sound like a wise, patient father, urging his wayward children to choose the path leading away from ruin and destruction. <em>"It's not too late...you will not be harmed...you have my word."</em> He wanted to sound benevolent and fair. Like he truly respected the Bajorans, like he was a special saintly Prefect, an <em>earnest </em>Prefect who only desired reason and resolution. <em>"I'm glad to see you've come to your senses..."</em> He would be so sad, so powerless against the natural consequences of the workers' bad behavior. <em>"I will be forced to release neurocine gas...I was hoping you would be reasonable...I'm sorry, but..." </em>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stomach turned as I listened to him address his captive audience as "Bajoran workers". I would call it <em>dehumanizing</em> if the word was technically correct&nbsp;-&nbsp;I mean, Bajorans aren't human after all. Maybe <em>demeaning</em> is what I'm looking for. Bad enough that this population had been forced into a diminished life of grueling manual labor in hazardous conditions under relentless threat of torture and death&nbsp;-&nbsp;now he breezily reduced them to the title 'workers' as if that was their chosen vocation and entire sum of their being. It grated at me, his fucking arrogant, condescending repetition of this demeaning phrase&nbsp;-&nbsp;even though I wasn't Bajoran and this wasn't my present life or my cultural history. No wonder Major Kira seemed to spit her words away from her lips whenever she spoke of this man.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept rolling my eyes at Justin, trying to lighten things up a little&nbsp;-&nbsp;I was feeling indignant and almost nauseated. Dukat's warnings grew precipitously more chilling. He stated that he would kill every Bajoran on the station&nbsp;-&nbsp;he would gas the Habitat Ring. <em>"Think of your families,"</em> he implored whoever the fuck he thought was listening to him.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pet massacre would begin in five minutes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed the only way to stop it&nbsp;-&nbsp;from Ops, where we were locked in to protect us from the rebels&nbsp;-&nbsp;was to take out the station's life support system, eliminating the ability to release any gas at all, deadly <em>or</em> good&nbsp;-&nbsp;like oxygen. The action made sense to us, so we felt okay about it, for lack of a better word. For a few moments we thought we'd at least bought ourselves twelve hours. Wrong&nbsp;-&nbsp;we learned from onscreen Dukat that because we did that, now the station would fucking self-destruct. In <em>two</em> hours.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garak&nbsp;-&nbsp;the tailor with the shop on the Promenade&nbsp;-&nbsp;had shown up a little while before, actually wanting to assist in any way he could, being a Cardassian with certain access codes and pieces of relevant knowledge. In no way do I blame him for the next thing that went wrong, but I may forever associate him with it. He tried impersonating Dukat so he could shut down the security program. It didn't work&nbsp;-&nbsp;it couldn't work&nbsp;-&nbsp;he said something about being sure we didn't have enough time, and what happened next was the absolute worst thing ever.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we knew what we were watching, we saw an unidentifiable spherical object materializing in the replicator. It was a fucking disruptor. It started shooting up the room. It missed a couple of us. But it got Justin. It <em>only </em>got Justin.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw it happen. It was over in an instant. The next instant was the terrible one, the heavy one, the one that came down over me like a lead shroud over my entire body. It pressed on me with its emptiness&nbsp;-&nbsp;the emptiness where Justin had <em>only one moment ago</em> occupied his rightful portion of physical space in our universe. I saw my friend dematerialize. I saw the very last parts of him vanish into nothing. It was horrible. I'd never dreamed that I would see anything like it, ever.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt like I should have stopped it from happening, instead of just watching it. Maybe if I'd reached out. Maybe if I'd <em>paused </em>the moment. Shouldn't I have tried? I felt like my mind, my comprehension, my sight, my feelings, everything <em>inner</em> about myself, had dematerialized with him. I felt blank and hollow, and lost. It seemed like all my senses were suspended somehow, like hanging in shards, in dully ringing cloudy shards.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just stood looking at the <em>nothing</em>. I don't know for how long. Likely not long at all. Dr. Bashir grabbed me by the shirt and hauled me down under the table with him. I remember the sudden yank and tumble to the floor. I huddled there in a shocked stupor. The space beyond my personal haze was a roar of crazed commotion. I heard continued disruptor blasts and yelling. I remember Bashir moving up and out for some reason and then immediately throwing himself back down next to me. I heard more yelling.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then slowly, kind of like fluid seeping into fabric from edge to center, the sound of Gul Dukat's voice spread into my ears and through my brain until it reached my processing center. His actual voice. In Ops.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the fuck was he doing there?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feels like that's what Kira spat at him. Something like that.
